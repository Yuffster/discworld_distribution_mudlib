<BR>
This is an inherit for hot food which cools down, 
based on the temperature of the room in which it 
finds itself and any containers it might be in. 
<P>
It performs just as normal food, apart from the following:
<P>
- If eaten while still hot it will cause the consumer to warm up for 
  a period of time.
<P>
- It only decays once it has finished cooling.
<P>
It's cooling level can be checked by query_cool_level().  This
starts at a value of twenty times the original weight of the 
hot food and determines how long it takes to cool down.  Larger items
cool more slowly.
<P>
The level of cooling is shown in the long and short of the object.
These are created using query_short_rotten_adjective and 
query_long_decay_level, and are based on the percentage by which it has 
cooled.
<P>

Differant messages can be displayed when the food is eaten hot or cold
These can be set using set_hot_eat_message() and set_cold_eat_message()
Messages can also be set for eating bites of food where appropriate
using setup_cold_eat_piece_messages() and setup_hot_eat_piece_messages()
