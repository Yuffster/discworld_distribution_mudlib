<BR>
This is an inheritable for frozen food which melts, 
based on the temperature of the room environment in 
which it finds itself. 
<P>
It performs just as normal food, apart from the following:
<P>
- It cannot be cured or dried
<P>
- It does not decay
<P>
- It cannot be forced to behave as a liquid
<P>
- When applied or eaten, it will cause a brief decrease
in temperature of the user.
<P>
It will melt into a liquid, which can be set using 
set_melt_result().  This is default at water, and can be 
queried using query_melt_result().
<P>
It's melt level can be checked by query_melt_level().  This
starts at a value of ten times the original weight of the 
meltable food.
<P>
It's rate of melting adjusts itself regularly, based on the
temperature.  This can be checked with query_melt_rate(), and
set temporarily with set_melt_rate.
<P>
The level of melting is shown in the long and short of the object.
These are created using query_short_rotten_adjective and 
query_long_decay_level, and are based on the percentage of 
object left.
