This is a clonable shovel object (a "shovel" in this case being anything
that can be used for digging, from a garden trowel to a steam shovel).
The "dig" command is defined with the following syntax:
<ul>
<li> "with <direct:object> in <string>"
<li> "with <direct:object> in <indirect:object>"
<li> "with <direct:object>"
<li> "[in] <string> with <direct:object>"
<li> "[in] <indirect:object> with <direct:object>"
</ul><br>
The do_dig() function tries to call a function dig() on this_player()'s
environment, which should be defined as
<p><code>
int dig( object indir, string indir_s )
</code><p>
where
<ul>
<li> <i>indir</i> is the <indirect:object> matched (if any)
<li> <i>indir_s</i> is the <string> matched, or the string that
     matched <indirect:object>
</ul><br>
Note that the command can match either actual objects or just strings;
also note that, although it will match room items, the object passed
won't really be of much use (which is why the string is passed also).
