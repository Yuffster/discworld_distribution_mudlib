<p><font size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font> 
<p>The intention behind this set of documents is to provide an introduction to 
  some of the fundamental concepts you'll need to understand as a creator on Discworld. 
  We'll be taking a quick drive through scary looking territory: Inheritance, 
  functions, logical operators and data types. However, don't be alarmed, as you'll 
  soon see that these are things that are Notte To Be Feared! Hopefully by the 
  end of these documents you'll feel comfortable with some of the basic concepts 
  that are needed to appreciate the later tutorials. </p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Please note that these documents are a work in progress. 
  Feedback would be appreciated on all aspects, particularly if you are a newbie 
  creator looking at these documents as a teaching aid. Areas that are deficient 
  or need further explanation (or are just plain wrong), can be mudmailed or <a href="mailto:drakkos@cableinet.co.uk">emailed</a> 
  to me, Drakkos, and I shall endeavour to modify the documents accordingly. Many 
  thanks. </p>
<p>N.B. Large patches of these documents were written at three in the morning, 
  on any number of seperate occasions. Go easy on me. :-P</p>
<p> <font size="+1"><font size="+2"></font><b><font size="+2">Table Of Contents:</font></b></font></p>
<p><b>Theory:</b></p>
<p> <a href="part_1.htm">Part One </a>:A brief introduction to LPC and a short 
  explanation of high and low level programming languages. We use LPC here on 
  Discworld... read this, and you'll learn why.</p>
<p> <a href="part_2.htm">Part Two</a> : An introduction to the various data types 
  in LPC, and examples of how and when they would be used.</p>
<p> <a href="part_3.htm">Part Three</a> : Lfuns and Efuns and Sfuns, oh my!</p>
<p> <a href="part_4.htm">Part Four</a> : An overview of inheritance, and how it 
  works in respect with LPC's object orientated hierarchy. </p>
<p><a href="part_5.htm">Part Five</a>: Flow Control... sequential, selection and 
  repetition structures, unveiled in all their glory!</p>
<p> <a href="part_6.htm">Part Six</a> : Operators in LPC, and how they can be 
  used to Control Your Flow With Style! </p>
<p>The above sections cover the theory of coding, such as control flow, inheritance, 
  data types and functions. Even if you are familiar with coding in other environments, 
  you should have at least a glance over the above to familiarise yourself with 
  the peculiarities of LPC. </p>
<p>If you have never coded before, you should make sure you read and understand 
  everything above before you progress on to the tutorials.</p>
<p><b>Practical:</b></p>
<p> <a href="tutorial_1.htm">Tutorial One</a> : Tutorial one starts off with the 
  basics and explains how one goes about creating a basic NPC. </p>
<p><a href="tutorial_2.htm">Tutorial Two</a> : Tutorial two builds on what we 
  did in tutorial one, and covers the basics of creating a room and moving an 
  NPC into that room. </p>
<p><a href="tutorial_3.htm">Tutorial Three</a> : Tutorial three further expands 
  on what we've already learned and explains how to create basic objects. It also 
  touches on virtual objects and how they work. </p>
<p><a href="tutorial_4.htm">Tutorial Four</a> : Tutorial four builds on what was 
  learned about rooms in the basic tutorial, and explains day/night longs/items/chats, 
  search functions, modify_exits, the linker, and more besides! </p>
<p><a href="tutorial_5.htm">Tutorial Five</a> : Tutorial five expands a little 
  on what we learned about NPCs, and discusses unique NPCs, guilds and races, 
  spells and combat actions, and more! </p>
<p><a href="tutorial_6.htm">Tutorial Six</a> : Tutorial six finishes off this 
  document and looks at coding objects again. It covers creating containers, wear 
  and remove functions, wield functions and attack functions. </p>
<p>If you are familiar with the material in the theoretical parts above, you should 
  attempt to work your way through each of these tutorials. They cover the basics 
  (and the not-quite-so-basics) of room, NPC and object coding. If you follow 
  and practise the instructions in these, you should be comfortable with everything 
  you need to know for starting out on your first project.</p>
<p> <font size="+1">Tutorial Exercises </font></p>
<p>For those who wish to try learning some extra code after completing the six 
  tutorials above, there is also a list of possible exercises <a href="tutorial_exercises.htm">here</a>. 
  The answers to these tutorial questions are located <a href="tutorial_answers.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>No peeking before you've given the exercises a shot yourself!</i></p>

  Ten Commandments of Room Descriptions</a> is another document I wrote that will 
  go over some of the more important Dos and Don'ts of writing good room descriptions.
