<p><b>Easy: </b>
<p>1) A plural for objects is automatically created when the object is setup. 
  We've already looked at how set_main_plural() can be used to change the default 
  way the mud pluralises our object. Using add_plural(), demonstrate how we can 
  add further plurals to an NPC. 
<p>2) It's possible to make an NPC auto attack any players who enter the room. 
  Using set_aggressive(), how would we do this? 
<p>3) We can provide our NPC with some cash by using the adjust_money() function. 
  How would we do this to provide our NPC with two Ankh-Morpork dollars and fifty 
  Ankh-Morpork pence? 
<p>4) Discworld being a magical place, it's not unusual for areas to have high 
  levels of background magic. How would you use the set_background_enchant() function 
  to give a room some ambient, residual magic? 
<p>5) Add_alias() can also be used on rooms to add additional labels for exits. 
  Demonstrate how you can alias exits to synonyms using this function. 
<p>6) Some rooms are, obviously, larger than others. Demonstrate how we can make 
  a room larger or smaller using the set_room_size() function. 
<p><b>More Difficult: </b>
<p>7) load_chat() allows for special character strings to be passed in which are 
  later expanded. The help file for expand_string() details the codes for this. 
  If passing in a command as 'emote swings $mposs$ hips.' will be expanded as 
  'The grey blob swings his hips.', what would we pass in to get: a) The capitalised 
  name of a random living object in the room b) The pronoun (he/she/it) of an 
  object attacking our NPC c) The short description of a random object in the 
  NPC's inventory. 
<p>8) If we pass in an array as action to be executed as a part of add_respond_to_with(), 
  the NPC will randomly perform one of the commands. How would you write an add_respond_to_with 
  to make an NPC say either 'bing' or 'bong' when the player says hello?
<p> 9) An NPC will execute a story of sorts if a load_chat action is passed in 
  as an array. How would we define a load_chat to make our NPC perform three actions, 
  one after the other, in order? 
<p>10) We've shown above how to move an object into a room. If we had a physical 
  object, such as a sword or a chest, how would it be possible to add the object 
  to a room without it appearing in the inventory line? Add_hidden_object() may 
  prove useful. 
<p>11) Modify exit is an extremely useful function in room coding, Have a read 
  of the helpfile and see if you can work out the code to a) Change the exit message 
  of a player so that it would appear as "<name> staggers off to the <direction>". 
  b) Change an exit so that it does not appear in the list of obvious exits in 
  a room. 
<p>12) We can give NPCs access to guild commands using the add_known_command function. 
  Using this and an add_combat_action, show how we can make an NPC crush and strike 
  at an enemy, should they have an appropriate weapon.
<p><b>Notes on Tutorial Questions: </b>If you have any ideas for tutorial questions 
  based on what is located in the newbie coding tutorial, then please mudmail 
  them to Drakkos. Also, if you have an idea for some neat little thing you'd 
  like to do in your objects, and it seems like it would make an instructive example, 
  mail your query to me and I'll see if I can make a tutorial exercise out of 
  it, with the appropriate answer code. Thx, flyheads!!
