<h1>Discworld mudlib version wibble</h1>

To setup and run this mudlib you will need to do the following things:

<ol>
<li>  If you wish to run mysql and connect up to the errors system you must
    turn on the database efuns in the local_options file.  This may be more
    difficult than this, consult the <a href="http://www.mudos.org">mudos</a>
    documentation.

<li>  First you will need to compile up the driver, the options you need to
    compile the driver with are listed in /driver/local_options in the
    mudlib directory.  You must edit the local_options file to get the
    directory to the find the config files setup correctly.  The mudlib
    comes with config files in the /driver directory.
    You copy the local_options file into the directory
    with your driver sources then run 'build.MudOS' and then 'make'.

<li>  Copy the driver binary into your bin directory.

<li>  If you are using mysql you must create the databases for the system
    to hook up to.  The system uses the databases 'discworld' and 'errors'.
    Once the database is setup you must setup the tables.  The table 
    definitions are in the db directory of the mudlib.  The following
    sequence of commands should setup your database.<br>
    You create these with:<br>
    <pre>
       mysqladmin create database discworld
       mysqladmin create database errors
       cd $(mudlibdir)/db
       mysql errors < errors
       mysql discworld < discworld
    </pre>

<li>  Setup your config.dw_distribution file, you will need to change the
    path to your mudlib and the binary directory in this file.  Setting
    your mud name as something other than 'dw_dist' would be a good
    idea too.

<li>  Edit the /include/config.h directory to setup any configurable mudlib
    options.

<li>  Edit /secure/master.c to set yourself up as an administrator.

<li>  Run the driver!<br>
       $(bindir)/driver config.dw_dist

<li>  Connect to the mudlib and everything should be working.  You may need
    to 'upgrade' after saving for the first time for some of the commands
    to turn on.
</ol>
