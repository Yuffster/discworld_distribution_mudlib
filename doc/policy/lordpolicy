.SH This is the Lord policy.

1.1
.SP 5 5
A person holding the rank of Lord does so because they have the
responsiblity for the management of a domain.  Should a Lord step
down from their role then they will be returned to the rank of Senior
Creator.
.EP

1.2
.SP 5 5 
A Lord is expected to manage the domain in a profession manner. This
means not only making sure that the domain is running smoothly and in
balance with the rest of the game, but also that work is being completed
on schedule and that people are effectively trained and managed.  A Lord
is also to ensure that every member of the domain is treated evenly and
fairly and that no personal feelings enter the matter when making
decisions.
.EP

1.3
.SP 5 5
The Lord may delegate authority as he or she see fit, but must be aware
that the same professional behavior is expected from those he or she
delegate to.
.EP

1.4
.SP 5 5
The information on the Lord channel and the Lord board is confidential
and should never be passed or to people who aren't Lords.
