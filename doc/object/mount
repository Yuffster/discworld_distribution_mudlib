.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Horses and Camels are wonderful methods of wandering around the world from the nice
high position of a saddle.

When you set the mount to walk off in a specific direction you can
set a modify which tells it how to walk in that direction.  If you set
the 'forever' modifier it will keep walking in the specified direction
until it cannot go that way any more.  If you specify the 'intersection'
modify the mount will keep walking until the mount finds an intersection.
If you specify the 'roughly' modifier the mount will attempt to keep
going in the specified direction as much as it can.  The mount will
always try and choose the a direction based on a weight, the weight is
calculated based on the size of the exit, the closeness to the desired
direction and if it not the exit it just came in on.

The 'rustle' command allows a thief to steal a player killers mount, this
will be a very very expensive proposition and is not able to be achieved
when the mount is being ridden.

The 'tack' and 'untack' commands allow you to dress your mount up in exciting
tack!  Similarly obvious are the 'tether' and 'untether' commands that allow you to tether your
mount to something.
