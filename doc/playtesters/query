.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command lists all the people online who currently have their playtester
protection enabled, and where they are.  

If they are within a location that has the string _pt or _dev within its
path, then they are in a PT area.  If not, then it is more of a judgement
call.  Some PT areas do not have the _pt or _dev strings within them
