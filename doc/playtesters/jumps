.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command gives you access to the playtester areas of the game.  It adds
in a way to quickly jump from a specific location to another location in the
game without having to have an in game exit available.  It can be easily
updated by the creators to give you easier time testing and more flexability.

To find out the current set of jump points you use: 'jumps list'.  This will
give the name of the room in which the jumps are available.  If you go to the
correct room and type in 'jumps list here' it will show a list of the jumps
with letter id's associated with them.  You can then jump to the specific
id.

The 'jumps armoury' command allows you to jump to and from the pt armoury.
The first time you use it, it will take you there and once there using it again
will take you back to where you came from.
