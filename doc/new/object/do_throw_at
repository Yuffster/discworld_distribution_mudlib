Name
.SI 5
do_throw_at - Function to calculate damage done when object is thrown.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
do_throw_at(object *in_dir, string direct, string indirect, mixed *args,
            string format)
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
If this function exists in an object, then when that object is thrown at
someone, it will be called.  It should calculate wether or not the object
hit the target, and how much damage it did.  It should return 0 if it failed
to hit, or the damage done.  You must NOT do the damage, it will be done be
the command throw.  The arguments are exactly the same as those passed from 
add_command, so look at the docs on add_command for a complete explaination
of them, however they are not going to be that difficult.  I'll give an 
example.  Say the player type 'throw daggers at dwarf' then the function 
do_throw_at() is going to get called in each dagger with the arguments
being as follows:
.EP
.SI 6
in_dir = ({ dwarf });
direct = "daggers";
indirect = "dwarf";
args = ({ "daggers", "dwarf" });
format = "%D 'at' %I";
.EI

Example

inherit "/std/object";

void setup() {
  set_name("rock");
  set_short("radioactive rock");
  set_adjective("radioactive");
  set_long("It's a small radioactive rock.\n");
} /* setup */

do_throw_at(object *in_dir, string direct, string indirect, mixed *args,
            string format) {
  int skill;

  skill = this_player()->query_skill_bonus("fighting.throw");
  if(skill < 40)
    return 0;      /* throw failed, no damage done */
  return skill/5   /* throw succed, skill/5 damage done */
}
