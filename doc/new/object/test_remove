int test_remove(object ob, int flag, mixed dest);

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This function tests to see whether the object `ob' is allowed to be removed
from the container it is in and put in `dest'.  If it returns 1, then leaving
is possible else it is blocked.  The `flag' is the value of the move flag as
set by set_get and reset_get.  This is 1 if reset_drop is called.  `dest' is
either the filename of the destination or the actual destination.
