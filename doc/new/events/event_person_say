Description
.SP 5 5
This is the function which is called when people say things.  The start
part of the message is the bit which is something like "Pinkfish says",
or "Pinkfish asks".  It is the bit put before the column and used for
formatting so the output looks neat.  The mess is the string which they
actually said, the lang argument is the language in which they spoke,
and the accent argument is the accent they used.
