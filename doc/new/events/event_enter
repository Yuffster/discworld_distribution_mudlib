Name
.SI 5
event_enter - Called when objects enter the room.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void event_enter(object ob, string message, object from);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This is the function called on things when something enters
their environment or themselves.  The from argument is where the object
came before it got to where it currently is.  The message is the
entrance message printed to the player when the thing enters.  This
message can be 0 and nothing will be printed.  Also note, this message
is processed using add_message, so it will not look very interesting if
you just print it.
