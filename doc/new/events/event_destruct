event_destruct - Called on an object when it will be destructed.

Syntax
.SI 5
void event_destruct();

Description
.SP 5 5
This is the function called on things when they about to be
successfully destructed by dest_me.  You should NOT attempt prevent
the destruction with this routine however you may notify something
else that the item is effectively gone.  If you need to prevent
destruction then mask dest_me() on the object.  The call is made using
a call_out so shadows may use the event.  This event is not a true
event in that it does not use the event system.  If anything substantial
is to be done by event_destruct a call_out should be invoked so that
dest_me can return promptly.
