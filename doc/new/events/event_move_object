Description 
.SP 5 5
This is the function called on things when they are successfully
moved, after the move has actually taken place and just before MOVE_OK
is returned to the caller of move.  The from argument is where the
object came from before it got to where it currently.  The to argument
which should be equal to environment().  The call is made using a
call_out so that shadows make use the event.  This event is not a true
event in that it does not use the event system.  If anything
substantial is to be done by event_move_object a call_out should be
invoked so that move can return promptly.
