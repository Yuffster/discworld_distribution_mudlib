Name
.SI 5
set_medium_alias - The medium_alias of this stuff.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void set_medium_alias(string alias);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Used for identification - choose something with
capitals (e.g. "ChalkDust") so players can't
use it as a valid alias by accident.

This is an internal alias for the object, so that various mudlib
related things can keep track of what sort of thing it really is.  Used
specifically when testing to see if there is another item of the same
type to join with when turning up in an inventory.

Example
.SI 5
/* Food inherits cont_medium */
inherit "/obj/food";
 
void setup() {
   set_name("rice");
   set_long(
"Little oval shaped hard nuggets, they are made almost totally "
"of starch.\n");
 
   /* Make it a continuous object */
   set_continuous();
   /* Set an alias to the medium so that it can be connected correctly */
   set_medium_alias("RiceStuff");
   /* How much of the stuff we have here */
   set_amount(100);
   /* 200 bits of rice weighs 1 weight unit */
   set_weight_unit( ({ 1, 200 }) );
   /* The name of a pile of them */
   set_pile_name("pile");
   /* The size of each of the amounts */
   set_amount_types( ([ "pinch" : ({ 1, "pinches" }),
                        "handful" : ({ 100, "handfuls" }),
                        "bucket" : ({ 10000, "buckets" }) ]) );
   /* The name for each of the sizes of piles */
   set_pile_types(({ 400, "small", 800, "medium", 1600, "large", "huge" }) );
} /* setup() */
