Name
.SI 5
query_weight_unit - The amount of this stuff.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
int *query_weight_unit();
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This returns an array of two elements:  ({ a, b }) means that b
units have weight a.

This allows you to define up less than the smallest weight weights
for continuous items.  ie: For rice the weight unit would be
something like ({ 200, 1 }) which means 200 of the objects weight
1 weight unit.

This is also used in food when the eat_effect is
run to modify the number passed into the eat_effect.  So the number
parsed in is the actual weight of the stuff eaten.
