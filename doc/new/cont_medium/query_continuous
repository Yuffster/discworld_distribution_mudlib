query_continuous - Is the medium continuous?
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
int query_continuous();
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Returns true if this type of stuff is continuous.  A continuous
medium or object is something that will automatically group.  An
example of this would be rice.  You would not want to have
hundreds of individual objects for each grain of rice, but if
you code it as a continuous object then you can refer to each
bit of rice individually or handfuls, or the whole lot.  Whatever
you want.
