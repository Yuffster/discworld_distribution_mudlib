query_pile_types - The name of different sized piles.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
mixed *query_pile_types();
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Returns an array consisting of paired numbers/names.  The numbers
and names refer to the name to give to the size of the pile of the
medium based on how much of it is there.

The size of the array will be odd, the last element being the name
to give to any larger size of pile.

Eg: ({ 50, "small", 100, "medium", 150, "large", "huge" }).  This
would mean that up to 50 of the things would be a small pile, up
to 100 would be a medium file, up to 150 would be a large pile
and anything larger would be a huge pile.

Eg: ({ 50, "small", "huge" }).  This would mean anything smaller
than 50 would be a small pile and anything else would be a huge
pile.
