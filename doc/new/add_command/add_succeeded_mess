Description
.SP 5 5
This allows you to change the succeeded message displayed when the
person succeededs with somewthing and you are using add_command.

It does several transformations on the message passed to it to
get nice useful messages out of it.  Each of the transformation
things start with a $ and have one letter after them.  A list of
them follows.

	$N	Name of the person.  Changes to you when printing to the player.
	$V	The verb.  Puts an s on the end when it is displaying it to everyone.
	$D	Direct object(s).  Makes a query_multiple_short list of the direct objects and stuffs it in here.
	$I	Indirect object(s).  Same as above, but the indirect ones.  These map to the ones got with %I in the original add_command.
	$p	Possessive string.
	$o	Objective string.
	$r	Pronoun string.
	$s	Pluralisation helper.  It becomes an 's' when printed to everyting and is not placed in when printed to the originator.
	$es	Another pluralisation helper.  Does the same as for 's' but it replaces with 'es' instead.  eg: reach -> reaches.
	$y	Another pluralisation helper.  It becomes a 'y' or an 'ies' depending on the pluralisation needed.

If no succeeded message is set for a given thingy.  To parseing the incoming
pattern to figure out the message to print.  It does this fairly well...

A good example of an object that uses add_command and this feature is
/obj/misc/torch.c
.EP
.SI 5

/* Light up the torch */
int do_light() {
/* Check to see if we are already lit */
  if (lit) {
    this_player()->add_failed_mess(this_object(), "$D is already lit.\n",
                                   ({ }));
    return 0;
  }
/* Set ourselves as lit. */
  lit = 1;
/* Tell the player about it. */
  this_player()->add_succeeded_mess(this_object(), "$N $V $D, and "+
                                    "the room glows with a soft light.\n",
                                    ({ }));
  return 1;
} /* do_light() */
