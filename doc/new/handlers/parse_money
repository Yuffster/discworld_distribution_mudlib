Description
.SP 5 5
This function, defined on the money handler, takes a string, the variable
words, and attempts to match it with objects in the object player; if
nothing matches the string, the function returns NO_MATCH.  It then looks
at each object matched to check if it is money; if no money is found, the
function returns NO_MONEY.  The handler then looks at the money, checking
to see if it is legal tender, according to the variable place, returning
any that isn't legal tender to the player; if there is no money that is
legal tender, the function returns NO_LEGAL.  Given that the function
finds some legal tender, it returns that money object.  The definition
MONEY_HAND for the money handler and the other definitions used above may
all be found in /include/money.h.
