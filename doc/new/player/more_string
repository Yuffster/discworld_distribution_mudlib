more_string  Shows a multiline string to a player

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
varargs int more_string( string text, string bity, int noreline ) {
.EI

.SH Description
.SI 5
This is the thingie you should use if you want to present multiline 
messages to the player that might be more that one page long.

text is the test you want to show to the player.

bity is the message used instead of the default "--- MORE"

noreline I don't know what does, perhaps someone who do can document it.

It returns 0 if the string was empty, calling notify_fail as well, and
1 if the string should be shown, so it's safe to do as in the example.
