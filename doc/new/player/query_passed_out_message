query_passed_out_message - Calculate the message to display when the
creature is passed out.

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
string query_passed_out_message()
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
When an object has the "passed out" property set, it is prevented
from performing any commands.  By default, a message saying "You are
unconscious.  You can't do anything.\n" is sent to the object.
If this function exists and returns a string, that string is
sent instead of the default message.

This function effectively generalizes the passed out property
to cover any situation in which the object should be prevented
from doing anything.  Be that because the object is honestly
passed out, or because it is subject to a basilisk's paralysis, or any
other reason.  Simply return the correct message from this function.
