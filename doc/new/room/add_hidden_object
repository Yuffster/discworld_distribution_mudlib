Name

add_hidden_object - Hidden objects in rooms.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void add_hidden_object(object ob);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This puts a hidden object into a room.  A hidden object is an object
that exists in the room as far as all the find_match calls go.  So,
for look at's and so on, but does not actually exist in the room so
it does not show up in the inventory when the player does a look.
This is the method used for putting signs and doors into rooms, that
actually have shorts and you can do things to, but do not show up
in the inventory.  The function init is also called on these objects
when init is called in the room.  The only thing you cannot put in
your init function is an add_action.  You can however define up bunches
of add_commands...

If this sounds complicated.  Think of it as an object that IS in the room,
but you cannot see it.
