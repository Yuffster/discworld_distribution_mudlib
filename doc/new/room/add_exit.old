Name
.SI 5
add_exit - Adds an exit to the room.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
int add_exit(string direc, string dest, string type);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Adds an exit to the room.  The direction is the direction in which the
exit should go.  This is something like "north" or "enter gate".  The
destination field is where the player will go when they enter the exit.
The type is a set type that sets a whole bunch of defaults for the room.

The types are controlled by /obj/handlers/room_handler.c.  The current
types and what this all means are:
.EP
.SO 10 15 -30
	road	Wide road.
	path	Narrower path.
	door	An exit with a door.  Defaults to closed, not locked.
	secret	A secret door.  Defauls to closed, not locked and not obvious.
	gate	A large door.  Defaults to open, not locked.
	corridor	A corridor (bing).
	hidden	A hidden exit without a door.
.EO

.SP 5 5
The room aliases are used to expand things for exits.  However they don't
expand the entire exit name.  They expand it in bits.  For instance,
if the exit was "enter live eel", you could add_alias("eel", "live eel");
and add_alias("bing", "enter"); to get both of the bits of the exit.
So "bing eel", "enter eel", "bing live eel" etc would work.

Example
.SI 5
add_exit("north", PATH+"market2", "road");
add_exit("enter live eel", PATH+"live_eel", "secret");
