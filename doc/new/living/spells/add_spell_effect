Description
.SP 5 5
This adds an effect into the spell effect array.  The type is supposed to
filter out the different sorts of effects into sperate distinct groups.
Things like "defense" and so on.  Each of these groups can be handled in
a different way, for instance you may only allow one defense type spell
to be active at any one time, or you may wish to allow any number of
them.  This is all completely up to the caller.  This just adds it
directly into the array, with no processing.  The number of rounds is
the amount of time the effect will stay on the object before vanishing.
