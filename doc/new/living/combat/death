Description
.SP 5 5
Death.  Death comes about when your hit points go to 0 or beyond.  Once
death occurs, you are dead.  No seriously now.  The death process
is along these lines.  When you die the function second_life is called
on the object that is dieing.  If this function returns a 0 then the
default processing of death occurs.  If it returns 1 then no other
processing is done at all.  (It is assumed you did it).  The default
processing creates a corpse.  Moves all of the equipment it can
from the living body onto the corpse, dests all of remainder then
dests itself.

Other functions that might be useful is the function make_corpse that
creates a corpse with the right characteristics (ie right bits and
that sort of stuff).  If also moves the equipment into it and sets
up the wielding/wearing on the corpse.

Death itself is in /d/sur/death/chars/death.  The function
person_died(string name) is called on him when a player dies to get
them to be visited by death.  You could fake these by calling the
function yourself :)

To turn yourself back from a ghost again, you call the function
remove_ghost on yourself and this dests the death shadow and resets
the properties on you that say that you are dead.  If you have died
and not finished being visited by death you should have the property
"noregen" set on you.  If this is set none of the resurrect/raise
spells will work on you.  The property "dead" will also be set on you.
This property specifies whether or not you are dead (funny that) and
none of the raise spells will work if this is not set.  The remove_ghost
function will remove the dead property, but not the noregen one.
