add_ac - This function gives an object an armour class, etc.

Syntax
.SI 5
int add_ac( string ac_name, string ac_type, mixed ac_arg );
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
The add_ac function is used when you want to give an object (usually armour)
the actual ability to protect against something.  Here's a brief breakdown
of it: If you take a look at the Syntax above, there are three parts to the
function.  String ac_name is the armour class name.  This can be anything,
but please use something meaningful.  String ac_type is the attack type.
Various and sundry attack types are listed in /doc/create/attack_types. The
mixed ac_arg is the actual armour class.  The higher this is, the better the
armour will protect you. If the argument is a number, the ac will be
random( number ).  If the argument is a 1 element array, the ac will be
that element.  With a 2 element array, ac will be the first element + random(
second element ). With a 3 element array, it will be first + second D third.
