Weapons
-------

This is a really basic guide to weapons, and keeping them within the bounds
of reality on the Disc.

Firstly lets have a quick definition of the weapon, and things that have to be
done with it. Here is an example weapon file:

inherit "obj/weapon";
 
void setup(){

/* DESCRIPTIONS */

   set_name("flail");
   set_short("flail");
   set_main_plural("flails");
   set_long("This flail looks quite nasty, having two large lumps of iron on "+
            "it. The whole thing looks quite dangerous.\n");

/* STATISTICS */

   new_weapon(600);
   set_damage_chance(10);
   add_attack("ball one", ({0}), 80, ({50,5,5}), ({0}), ({15}), "sharp" );
   add_attack("ball two", ({0}), 10, ({50,10,5}), ({100}), ({200}), "magic" );
   set_weap_skill( "fighting.combat.melee.blunt" );
   set_weight(200);
}

OK now lets run down what all these numbers in the STATISTICS section mean.

firstly the new_weapon() call. This sets up all it's initial statistics. The 
paramater represents the condition of the weapon.

the set_damage_chance() call sets the chance that the weapon will be damaged
when used in combat. This affects the condition. The amount of damage done is
based on how much the armour reacts.

the add_attack() call is the most complicated, and sets up the statistics of the attacks for the weapon. It is possible to have multiple attacks from one weapon,
so this can be used to simulate all sorts of intersting things.

taking the paramaters to add_attack one at a time:
"ball one"   - 	This is just the name of the attack. It's nothing special, but 
		it's helpful if it's named to something appropriate.
0            - 	This is for more advanced things. It allows you to set follow
		on attacks, so that if the ball hit them, then the spikes on
		the ball could rip them to shreds. The values that can be used 
		here are as follows :
		   0 	- no follow on attack.
		   "name"   - the name of the attack to follow on after this
 			      one. If you supply this, then you must also
			      add another paramater, being :
				0-100 - chance of this follow on attack.
				200+  - the amount of damage over hit that must
					be done to achieve a follow on.
80  	     -  This is the percentage chance that the attack will occur when
		a round of combat occurs.
({50,5,5})   -	This is the basic stat of the weapon attack. It affects both
		the "to hit" chance and the damage of the attack. It translates
          	to 50+5d5 ie. 55-75. If defined with one argument (eg. ({75}))
		then it will translate to random(75) ie. 1-75.
({0})	     - 	This represents the "to hit" bonus of the attack. The bigger, 
		the more likely it is to hit above and beyond the basic amount.
		It's form is the same as attack 
		damage above.
({15})	     - 	This represents the "damage" bonus of the attack. The bigger, 
		the more damage it does above and beyond the basic amount.
                It's form is the same as attack damage above.
"sharp"	     - 	This is the type of attack the weapon is delivering. Different
 		armours protect different amounts for different attacks. Valid
		attack types are SHARP, PIERCE, BLUNT, MAGIC, FIRE, COLD

The set_weap_skill() call defines which skill the weapon uses to calculate the
success of the attack.
