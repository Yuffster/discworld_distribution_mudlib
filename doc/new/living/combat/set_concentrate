Name

set_concentrate - Sets the concentrate flag.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void set_concentrate(int f);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
If the concentrate flag is set to true (non 0) then the creature will
concentrate its attacks on one object, instead of chooseing a random
opponent in the battle.  This sort of makes the creature more and less
effective at the same time.  Useful huh?
