Name
.SI 5
convert_message - processes observer-dependent messages
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
string convert_message( string words )
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This is a utility function provided as a means to process a message
from the point of view of the observer.  This processing occurs
automatically when the message is used in write, say, tell_object or
tell_room, but if the message is to be stored, it needs to be processed
before being stored.  It does not process ANSI colour codes and will
not handle indentation or paging if those codes are in the message.
