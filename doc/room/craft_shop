.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

A place where players can buy and sell goods for their own specified prices.
When you sell an item it gets you to choose a price to sell it for and name
to sell it as.  This allows the seller to control what the buyers will see
when they list the contents of the shop.  When the item is listed it is given
a two letter abbreviation, this abbreviation can be used to buy the
specified item from the shop.

The seller will only get royalties for the item sold once it has actually
been sold.  The shop itself will take a certain percentage of the sell price
as royalties.
