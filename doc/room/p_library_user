.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a place where librarian players can add any books they see fit, for
other players to subsequently borrow.

You can browse the catalogue using the commands described above to find the
item you want. When you borrow an item, you are told when it must be returned
by before you start being charged. You will not be able to borrow more items
whilst you have outstanding fines.

Remember this is a community run library with finite resources. It can only lend
as many copies of an item that other librarian players have added. 

Normally you have to be explicitly allowed to use the library by one of the 
librarians, so you should approach them if you do not have access to use it.

You can report lost or damaged books with the 'report' command. You will
be charged a set amount and the loan will be cleared. The library will not be
able to get that copy of the item back, so librarians won't be happy if
you lose too many books.
