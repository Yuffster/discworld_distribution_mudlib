.SH Description
.SP 5 5
A terrain room is part of a larger collection of rooms that connect
together and do wonderful things.  They are connected together via a
text map and allow larger areas to be mapped and navigated with
relative ease.

There are two methods of getting through a terrain, you can either walk
or journey.  If you walk then you move one step at a time, if you use
journey then you move multiple steps at a time.  The default exit, as
in the exit name without the 'walk' or 'journey' will pick either one of
these two methods to use.  The method chosen is set using the 'options
personal travel'.

While in a terrain it is possible to see the adjacent rooms around you that
are visible using the 'map' command.  The map will display a small
map on the screen allowing you to see the visible rooms around you.
