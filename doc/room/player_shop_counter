.SH Description

.SP 5 5
This is the area behind the counter, accessible to employees only.

The cash register is located here, along with the sales log.  All
money added to or removed from the register is logged automatically.
The log should be used whenever a transaction takes place, so that the
supervisors and managers can easily tell what is being bought & sold,
and for how much.

If a mistake is made when logging, you may make a correction to the log.
Try to make a correction as soon as possible so it appears next to the
original entry.
