.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The real estate agents auction house, player housings, flats and other properties, both personal and business.   Properties are made available for
rental or purchase (indicated on the lot itself).

As a property becomes available, it is put on the market.  Offers
are made by bidding, and the winner of the auction receives the
property.

Houses and other property of a personal nature will currently only be available for rent, while shops will only be available for purchase.

If the house was up for rental the winning bid becomes the (Discworld)
monthly rent and that rent is automatically deducted from their bank
account every month.  If the house was up for purchase the winning bid
is a one-time cost.

Once you have won an auction you must come back and 'claim' your
house.  When you claim it is when you own the house.  You will pay
your first months rent in advance.

You may request a replacement housing rental or ownership agreement
with the request command if you've lost your original copy.
