.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

Allows you to make print runs of different sorts of books.  You can print
off as many copies as you like of the book you wish.  If you claim
copyright on a book then no one else can print off a book that is the
same or similar to your book.  This means that you control the printing
rights of the book.

If the print shop accepts it, it will print books into different languages.

The print shop will always place a fly leaf into your book which will
tell when and where the book was printed.

Once you have finished printing the book you can collect the finished books
from the collection office.  The printing and collection services can be in
the same or different rooms.
