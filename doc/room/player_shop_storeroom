.SH Description

.SP 5 5
This is the storeroom, accessible to employees only.

The storeroom holds several stock cabinets, each capable of holding
a fixed number of items.  The simplest way to add and remove items
is to let the storeroom automatically assign items to cabinets.
However, you can specify which cabinet you want to add/remove items
to/from.

You may also list the contents of all cabinets, the contents of an
individual cabinet, all items, or individual items in an individual
cabinet.

There is a shopping bag dispenser for the convenience of customers.
Shopping bags should be distributed wisely, depending on the number
of items sold.

There may be a situation in which the maximum number of items cannot
be stored due to cabinet assignments. This is the responsibility of
supervisors and managers to administer.
