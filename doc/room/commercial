.SP 5 5
This is a player house that allows a player to add commercial properties
and elements to it.  You can make people have entry fees, run commercial
enterprises.

Commercial enterprises will have different commercial objects in them.
The commercial objects will all have their own help associatd with them.

The use expression controls the access to all the elements in the commercial
property.  It will be called with a specified 'type' which can be used to
turn on and off various elements of the shop.

User defined functions can also be enabled in the room.

The 'purchase' stuff command makes an npc turn up that you can then buy
equipment for your commercial property off.

The commercial property can be 'terminated' at any time using your
housing agreement.  This will put the property up for auction again.
