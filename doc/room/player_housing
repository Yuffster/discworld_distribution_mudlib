.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room that players can control the look of.  It allows you to
place and displace furniture in the room, decorate the walls, floor
and ceiling and also change the locks.  Only people which are allowed
to place and displace the furniture can do so.

.SH Allow and Deny
.SP 5 5
The allow and deny commands enable the home owner to control who is
permitted to make changes to their home.  These commands typically
work on a per-room basis, however if you are in the main room of the
house (usually the one just inside the front door) the commands take
an extra parameter and enable you to authorise people to control any
room in the house.

Note that to prevent multiplaying a player must be present in order to
be allowed to control a room.

.SH Placement
.SP 5 5
Placing furniture is, by its very nature, somewhat complicated. Using the 'place help <item>' command can assist by telling you the options that are available for a given piece of furniture.
