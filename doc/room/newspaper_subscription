.SH Description
.SI 5
In this room people can get subscriptions for a specific newspaper.  These are either for a pre-paid number of issues or infinite.
Both types can be cancelled by unsubscribing, but the money for a pre-paid one will not be returned.
Whenever a new issue is released, it will be sent to the subscribee via the parcel-service.
With an unlimited subscription the paper is authorized to withdraw the money for each issue from your bank account(s).

-= WARNING=-   Unlimited subscriptions are subject to possible changes of the newspaper's price.

It is also possible to aquire newspaper boxes.  When placed in a house, trained imps will deliver new issues directly to the box.
Each box is bought with enough demon-bait for a given number of issues and cannot be refilled.
An international box uses stronger bait, allowing the imps to find it even if the newspaper-office and the house are on different continents.
