.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

This is where you need to go to become a citizen of an area.  It will check
all the specified conditions and then put you in the list of people waiting
to become a citizen if you successfuly make them all.  To actually become
a citizen a magistrate must approve your application.  They do this
by sponsoring you.  If they deny you, then you will be denied.

Citizens can sponsor and deny other people to show their support or
non-support for the people who are applying for citizenship.

Magistrates can do a few extra things in this room.  They can add and
remove people from a black list of people not allowed to use the room,
they can set the expression used for citizenship approval and they can
check to see why a person was denied citizenship in the past.

The variables able to be used in the expression are: ageindays, ageinhours,
level, timesincedeniedindays. 
The functions able to be used in the expression are: citizenof(place),
magistrateof(place).
