.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

The guild is the place where you can join the guild and learn specific
guild taught skills.  The 'info' command will give you information about
the guild before you join it, the 'join' command is the one that actually
allows you to join the guild.

Primaries are specific skills that your guild will teach very cheaply to
a high level.  Every guild has a different set of primaries and you can
see what they are by using the 'cost primaries' command.  The various
cost commands will tell you how much it will cost to raise your skills
by various amounts, and the 'advance' command will actually raise your
skills.

With all the skill names you can abbreviate their name down to the
smallest unique match.  For example, fighting.combat.melee can be
abbreviated to fi.co.me
