.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

This room is the heart of the rule control system for the game.  It allows
people to list rules, and vote on new rules.

The rule id and the motion id's can be found by listing the rules and
motions respectively.

The allowed types for the rules are 'general', 'citizen' and 'immutable'. 
All rules of the type 'immutable' cannot be changed or added to.

Rules of the type 'citizen' will only apply to citizens, 'general' rules
apply to everyone in the city.

Amendments are changes to the actual rules, if you make an amendment
to a rule then the amendment becomes a clarification of the rule.  Comments
can only be made by magistrates and they are removed when the motion is
opened up for voting by the citizens.

Motions go through three stages: 1) magistrate discussion, 2) magistrate
voting and 3) citizen voting.  For a motion to be passed it must be passed
by both the magistrates and the citizens.  A motion can only have amendments
made to it while it is in the magistrate discussion period.  Comments
can be added up till the end of the magistrate voting period.
