.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows people to setup new cases for administration, add notes
and control the cases in various ways.  You can get a listing of each
case and a listing of all the current cases.

The result used in the close of a case must correspond to one of the names
specified in the list punishments.  If any extra details are required
you will be asked to enter them as you continue.

You can list all the recently closed cases using the 'list closed' syntax.
You can then list each case in more detail by using its id.

The closed cases you can list are any cases that were recently closed
(within the last 2 weeks), after this they are moved into the archive and
are also no longer able to be appealed.

For a case to be appealed you must find a magistrate to appeal the case
for you.  The magistrate must be different to the one that closed the
case.

You can only modify a case if you are a magistrate and you are not involved
in the case directly (either opened it or one of the people complained about).
However, you can always add notes to cases.

You can get more information about what the punishments do using the
'list punishment fine' syntax.
