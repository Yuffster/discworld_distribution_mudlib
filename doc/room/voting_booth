.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This room allows you to vote for three different things, elections, motions
and issues.  Elections are for the magistrates, motions are for new rules or
ammendments to rules and issues are any sort of vote the magistrates which to
put forward.

This is where you go to vote for people to be magistrates.  The information
command allows you to see if there is an election in progress or how
long it is before the next one.

To accept a nomination you must nominate yourself for the position.

To vote you must vote for the number of people that there are magistrate
positions.  This means if there are 7 magistrate positions you get
7 votes.  You may only vote for any one person once.  If you only wish to vote for less
than the number of magistrate positions you should use the 'vote force'
command.
