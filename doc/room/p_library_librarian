.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Librarian players can maintain the books within the library with the
above commands.
Once a book (or leaflet or paper) is added, it is given a unique id which 
will be used to manipulate the book in most other commands.

To add another copy of a book with an existing id, simply add the same item
with the same title and author. It must obviously, be the same item :)

Items can only be removed from the library once all copies have been
returned. Once removed from the library, all the copies will be placed
on the floor.

Marking the item as reference only, will prevent people leaving the library
with it.

You can see a player's account status (his currently borrowed books and fines etc..)
with the status command.

You can report lost or damaged books for players with the report command. This will clear
the loan for that person and charge them the current fine for lost books. The library
will not be able to get his copy of the item back once it has been reported lost or damaged.

Access to use the library can given with 'set access'.

Other variables can also be changed with the various other set commands.
