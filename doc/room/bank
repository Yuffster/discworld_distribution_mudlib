.SH Description
.SP 5 5
A bank provides a place to store money, safe from loss and theft.  Some
banks have branches in more than one area, ensuring you can retrieve
your money in a different place than you stored it.

Banks will charge an administration fee (typically 5-10%) on deposits,
with withdrawals being free of charge.  This fee, however, may well
be justified if it avoids you losing your life's savings next time you
wander inadvertently into the Shades.

Additionally, if you apply for a job at a player-run shop, you will need
a bank account as your wages will be paid direct into a nominated account.
In this case, there is no administration fee on deposits.
