.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

This is the same as the standard craft shop, except it allows you to specify
categories for your wares.  This splits up the listing into sections and
also allows you to only view one category at a time.

When specifying a category, you can use a shortening of it.  For example,
'healing' could be shortened to 'heal'.

See the craft_shop help file for help on the normal craft shop commands.
