.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

An item shop will only sell very specific items to you, only what it has
already in its inventory.  It will not buy anything off you and has
restricted numbers of certain items.

An item shop allows you to buy items based on their letter which is shown
in the list command.  This allows you to buy specific objects without
accidently buying the wrong one.
