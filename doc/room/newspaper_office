.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a place in which you can organise and publish a newspaper.  The
editor has complete control over the paper and can edit and change the
articles and setup their order.

A reporter can submit new articles and retrieve and remove their old articles.
You can also change the title and the displayed author for the articles.

To become a reporter you 'apply' to be a reporter.

The 'claim' command allows you to receive a new set of press creditials for
the paper.

You can only delete and edit your own articles.  The editor can edit and
delete any articles.

You can change the type of the article to be html or plain.  This does not
change any of the text of the article, merely how it is displayed.  The
recognised html tags are: <ul> </ul> <ol> </ol> <dl> <dd> <dt> </dl> <p>
<li> <br> <pre> </pre> <b> </b> <i> </i> <code> </code> <center> </center>

On publication of an issue all reporters will be rewarded with 60,000xp per
article they published.  The editors will be rewarded with 120,000xp plus
10% of the xp awarded to the reporters shared among them.  So one editor
will get more xp than 2.

When a newspaper is published the index page is generated automatically.

The command 'add reporter' can be used to hire on anyone as a reporter.  They do not
need to be logged in and they do not need to apply first.  The command
'remove reporter' can be used to fire the person from being a reporter altogether.

To make someone into an editor you use the command 'promote' and to turn
things back into a normal reported you use the command 'demote'.

Editors can 'lock' the office so that reporters cannot editor or add
any new articles or adverts.  This allows the editors to make sure that
no one messes with things before they go to print.

The logs can be used to view events which have occured in the newspapers
article history.

The owner can deposit extra money into the pool of money for the reporters
to be paid out of.  This allows the owner to pay extra money or bonuses from
their own pocket.
