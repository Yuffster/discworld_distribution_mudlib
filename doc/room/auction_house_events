Auction House Events - Special mailer messages that may be customised for internal auction house events
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
When certain events occur within the auction house commercial object, the house needs to be able to inform people of these events.  For instance, when an object receives no bid in the amount of time given, or when an object is successfully sold to someone.  These messages may be customised by the owner of the commercial property, utilising control codes described below.
