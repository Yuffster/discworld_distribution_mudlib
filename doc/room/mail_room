.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

Allows you to send wonderful messages to people about things you have
seen or done, or about anything else for that matter.  If you type mail
by itself it will drop you into a menu driver mailer interface.  If you
type a persons name after 'mail' it will directly send that message
to someone.

The help file 'mail' will give you quite comprehensive help on how to
use the mailer.
