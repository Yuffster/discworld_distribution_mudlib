This is a room help file.

Pawn shops will buy items from you, usually only ones over a certain
reasonably high price.  However, the difference between a pawn shop
and a general store is that the pawn shop will give you a chance to
get your item back.  They're useful if you need money fast in the
short term.

You use the pawn command to pawn your item to the shop.  Your item
will be exchanged for its value, and a Pawned Item Receipt.  This
receipt is very important - don't lose it, as it's the only thing
that can get you your item back!

The shop will give you a time limit, by which time your item must
be reclaimed.  If you do not collect it by that time, your receipt
will expire and become useless, and the shop will sell your precious
item to recoup its costs.

Use the reclaim command to get your item back.  You will need to be
in the pawn shop that you pawned the item at, and have the receipt
and appropriate currency to the value of the item in your inventory.
The shop will also charge a percentage to return your item; this is
usually 20% of the value of the item on top of the amount loaned, but
will generally be on display somewhere in the shop.

Expired items appear in the shop's inventory.  It works just like a
general store, and you can list, browse and buy objects.  The only
thing you can't do is sell objects; pawn shops only accept objects
for pawn.  They don't buy them.
