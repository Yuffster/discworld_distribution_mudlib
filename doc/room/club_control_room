.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a room help file.

This place allows you to control all of the aspects of your club.  It
allows you to create clubs, disband clubs, add and remove recruiters,
set your description and all the financial activities.

Club insignias are the badges that people can wear which have all their
club related commands on them.  The cost of an insignia is taken from
the players current money, not from the club's coffers.

If the club goes into remission for 2 pay periods then the club will
be disbanded.  If the club is not touched for 8 real weeks then
the club will be disbanded.  A club is considered touched if a
member is added or removed, if an election is held or nominations
are added, money is deposited into the account.

Clubs default to being founder controlled clubs, this means the
founder has all the control of the club.  Once a club gets over
members it can change to an elected club, in this mode the
committee members of the club are elected to their positions.  Once
a club gets over  30  it must
become an elected club.  A
new election will be forced by the Patrician every 2 Discworld
years and an election can be forced 1/2 a Discworld year after the
last election.

If the founder of a founder base club leaves the mud or is idle is
for 8 real weeks then the club will be disbanded.
