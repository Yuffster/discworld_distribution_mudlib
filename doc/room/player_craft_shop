.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is an extension of the category craft shop, it does all the things that
it does plus is adds some extensions to work for players control.

This allows a player to setup a craft shop and control the inventory of
the shop.  They also make money on each purchase.  A player will sell the
item to the shop normally and the shop will then place the item into a
list of items which are to be accepted.  The player can change any of the
various values of the item, both before and after it is placed for sale.

If someone acidently sells something they didn't want to, they can get it
out of the shop by using the 'reject <id>' syntax.  This will only
work on items they, themselves have added.  The players can also see
which items have been added to the shop and have not yet been accepted
or rejected with the 'waiting' command.

*NOTE* There are two waiting lists, there is the approved and unapproved
waiting lists.  The approved waiting list is anything that was approved
by the owner functions.

To run the shop you will need the Shop Owners Guide which is available
at a book store near you.
