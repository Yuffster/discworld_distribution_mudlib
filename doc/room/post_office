This is a room help file.                                                  
     
Allows you to send messages to people.  If you type mail by itself
it will drop you into a menu driver mailer interface.

If you type a person's name after 'mail' it will directly send that
message to the person in question.

The help file 'mail' will give you quite comprehensive help on how to
use the mailer. 

The parcel office is for depositing parcels for other players or for
collecting parcels that other players have sent to you.

You can choose to send a parcel anonymously or let the receiver know
who it is from.

Please remember that sending items between two of your own player 
characters is considered multiplaying and cheating.

It is strongly recommended that you remember the following:

1. Each item sent will incur a fee,

2. No money can be sent via parcels

3. Avoid depositing nested items 

   Nested items are, for example, an item in a bag which is placed 
   inside a box which is put inside a backpack, etc
