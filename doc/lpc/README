This directory contains documentation about the language used to program
objects and all external functions accessible by objects. Lars tried to make
it similar to C, as many people know how to program C. Lars called it LPC,
to connect it to the name LPmud.

WARNING: LPC is *not* C if you are a C programmer do not expect the same
old tricks to work see the file DIFF for a fairly complete list of the 
differences between the two languages.

Programs in an object are compiled into a special tree form, to speed up
evaluation.
This directory documents all external functions accessible by objects.
