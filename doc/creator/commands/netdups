.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The netdups command gives a listing of all potential multiplayers by checking
if there are multiple players logged on from the same IP address.  The command
gives the names of the players, the IP number, the IP name and a list of names
which are not registered as allowed to be on from the same IP address.
The info for the last field is taken from the multiplayer info database.

You can add or delete multiplayers (allowed or not) with the multiplayer
command.  The default is that they are not allowed, however, if you add them to
the multiplayer info database as not allowed, their logons will also cause
automatic "multiplay" events in their playerinfo as well as "multiplayer" type
informs.

The output of netdups can be changed with the set command.  The current output
settings can be displayed with the review command.
