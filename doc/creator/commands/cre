.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The command cre is used to communicate with other creators on this
mud.  All other creators, lords, and high lords will see the
message unless, of course, they have the channel earmuffed.

cre@<text> is used to emote on the channel.  It prepends your
name to the text, so that "> cre@flops around" -> "Dreldragon
flops around".  It will have "(cre)" before the
emote to let people know it's on the cre channel.

cre? lists all the creators on the channel at the moment.
