.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Ed is the editor that you can use from inside the mud.  Following is the list
of commands that can be obtained from inside ed by typing 'h'.  The file you
specify will be expanded and if it matches to more than one file, the first
file you specify will be used.  If the file cannot be written by you, it will
also print [read only].  Any changes you make, will not be saved if that is the
case.  Ed is very similar to ex and ed on unix machines so if you can find
documentation for those commands, it will help you in ed.

Some old help from 2.4.5....

When in 'ed', the prompt is ':'.

Ed has two modes, command mode and insert mode. The insert mode has
no prompt. You exit the insert mode by typing a single '.' on a line.

All commands have the following syntax:

X,Ycmd

or
Xcmd
.EP

For example:
.SI 5
1,10p
Will print line 1 to 10.
1,5d
Will delete line 1 to 5.
8p
Will print line 8.
.EI

.SP 5 5
A '.' is the "current line". The current line is the last line
referenced. If you want to print last line + 10 more:
.EP
.SI 5
.,.+10p

Commands that use a line range:
If no line is given, then curent line is printed.

.SO 5 8 -15
	p	Print line.
	d	Delete line.
	l	Print line with control characters.
	r file	Read in a file after the line specified.
	s	Substitute patterns. See special documentation.
	z	Print 10 lines.
	a	Start insert mode after specified line. Exit with '.'<return>.
	i	Start insert mode before specified line. Exit with '.'<return>.
.EO

.SI 5
Commands used without line specification:

.EI
.SO 5 8 -15
	q	Quit. Won't work if file is changed.
	Q	Quit and discard all changes if not saved.
	w	Write the file out.
	w file	Write the file out with name 'file'.
	e file	Edit a file.
.EO

.SP 5 5
As line numbers '.' is current line, and '$' is last line of file.
Thus '1,$p' will always print all of the file.

Substitutions are very advanced.

First a simple example:
.EP

.SI 5
s/apa/bepa/
.EI
.SP 5 5
This will substitue the 'apa' in current line to 'bepa'.
If an 'p' is appended, you will also immediately see the result.
.EP
.SI 5
1,$s/apa/bepa/
.SP 5 5
Same, but all lines in file. Only first occurence on every line.

Any character can used instead of '/':
.EP
.SI 5
s!apa!bepa!g
.EI
.SP 5 5
The 'g' specifies that all occurences of apa on this line are changed to bepa.

The pattern that are supposed to be replaced, can be a regular expression.

Searching is done with:
.EP
.SI 5
/hello/
Find first line in of after current line.
Just // will repeat the search.

There are special characters that can be used in the pattern:
.EI
.SO 5 8 -15
	.	Match any character.
	x*	Match any numbers of x (0 or more).
	[abc]	Match 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
	[0-9]	Match any digit 0 - 9.
	[a-z]	Match any lowercase letter.
	\x	Match 'x' where 'x' can be any character except '(' and ')'.
.EO

Example:
.SI 5
s/ab.d/ABCD/
.EI
.SP 5 5
Substitute any string 'abXd' against 'ABCD' where X can be any character.

How to copy from a standard file.

Enter ed. Then do 'r /room/vill_green.c'. Now you have something in the
buffer. Change it into what you want it to be. Then 'w /players/peter/hall.c'.
Or 'w hall.c'.
