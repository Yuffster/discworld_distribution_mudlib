.SH Name
.SI 5
dbxframe - Print error context based on an error trace.
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
dbxframe [<player>] <frame>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
dbxframe can be used to look at the context of the function call in a line of
an error trace.  You can use it on yourself (the default) or on
<player>.  The <frame> argument is the line number in the error trace which
you got when you used dbxwhere.  The line which contains the function call is
prepended with '=>' and is highlighted, if you have a terminal capable of
doing that.  It will also mention the arguments to the function and its local
variables.  An example will make things clearer, I guess.
