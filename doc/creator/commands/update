update - Updates the objects in memory copy

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
update <object specification>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Update is used to bring the copy of an object that the mud is using up to date
with the copy that is being used on disc.  It is useful when you are editting
an object.  Before you clone the object after you make any changes, you must
update it or the mud will not realise the change.  Certain other things are
equivilant to updating, but it is safer if you just update while you are
learning.

Update destructs the existing loaded copy if there is one and then loads the
new version for you.  If an object is not currently loaded, update will load it
for you.
