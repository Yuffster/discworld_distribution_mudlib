.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command is used to manipulate the errors stored in the sql
database.  The different options to the command allow different sets of
errors to be selected.  You can find all the errors assigned to you with
the 'mine' clause, all the errors assigned to other people with the
'assigned' clause.  You can specify a specific directory and recursively
check if needed.  You can also find all the bug reports made by a specific
person with the 'by' clause.

When run, the command will show the first report in the your
current query results.
At which time you have a lot of nice
commands of which the most important is "s" which will change the
status of the bug and send a reply to the person who made the bug.

If you can see the bugreport has been made incorrectly and really belongs in
another dirctory, you can forward it with the "f" command.

.SH Commands
.SO 5 10 -20
	f n	Forward and delete error to directory n.
	s <status> <cat>	Change the status of the bug.  The basic use of this command is: s FIXED, or s DENIED, or s THANKS.  This will change the status of the bug correctly and send a standard message to the recpient.  You can send a custom message by going: s FIXED custom.  You can send no message at all by going: s FIXED none.  There are short forms for all the types used in this command, they are: f -> fixed, d -> denied, t -> thanks, n -> none, u -> custom, c -> considering, i -> fixing.  So you can do: s f n, to set the status to fixed and not send a message.
	t <type>	Update the type of the bug, this allows you to change the bug to be an IDEA, TYPO or BUG.  ie: t TYPO
	a <person>	Assign the bug to the specific person.
	o <category>	Updates the category of the bug.  The category is the thing it was attached to.  Eg: c ROOM
	i, l	List the bugs in columns, similar to the web page.

	c	Comment on the bug.
	n/+	Next error.
