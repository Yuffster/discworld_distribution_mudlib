.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Meteor is a command used only as a punishment for players that 
are being rather rude and uncooperative with creators that are
attempting to interact with them in a reasonable manner.  It
causes a large and somewhat spammy meteor to fall on them, forcing 
them to quit.  The message is visible over the entire mud.  It 
should not be overused, or used improperly, such as for amusement,
or because someone requests it.  Be sure to have a legitimate 
reason, as it adds an entry to the affected player's playerinfo.

Keep in mind that some players find it desireable to get meteored 
and may deliberately provoke a creator to do so, usually after 
seeing it happen to someone else, or being informed that it will 
only happen to them if they misbehave.  Encouraging them is not
recommended.
