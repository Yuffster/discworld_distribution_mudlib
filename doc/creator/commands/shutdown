.SH Name
.SI 5
shutdown - Shuts down the mud
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
shutdown <time> <reason>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Shutdown is the last resort when the mud becomes unbearably slow, or very
strange things are happening.  It should not be used unless absolutely
neccesary.  Lpmud is very good at crashing itself at least every few days,
so there should never develop the case where the mud needs to be shutdown.
The mud does gradually slow down as it has been up for a long time, but on
a decent machine, you won't notice this.  It also may be neccesary to shutdown
if the memory usage gets extremely high, but the mud should be made to do
this itself rather than getting creators to shut the mud down manually in
this circumstance.  You must supply a reason as to why you are shutting down
the mud.

Directors and above can set the minimum time to 0 using "now" whereas
the default minimum is 10 minutes.
