.SH Description
.SP 5 5
ls is used to list the files in a directory.  Directories have a '/' appended
to them.  If no directory is given, it will default to your current directory.
You can also specify patterns to match to so that not all files will be
listed.

The -F option will put a '*' on the end of a file if it is loaded, it will
place a '@' on the end of a file if it is in the autodoc system and it
will place a '/' on the end if it is a directory.

ls has a number of options, -CF being the defaults:
