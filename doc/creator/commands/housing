.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The housing command lets you view (and modify) information about houses
stored in the housing handler.  The housing handler is used to handle the
sale/rental of all houses on the Disc.  It keeps track of who owns which
house, where that house is, how much the rent is etc.

Only add a house to the handler if it is in the game and open for players.
Any vacant house in the handler will automatically get put up for auction!

Each house has a primary room and any number of subsidiary rooms.  A house
must always be referred to by this rooms filename.

.SH Altering house information
.SP 5 5
Add a house to the handler is done with the 'housing add' command.  You
must provide the filename of the main house room, the region of the Disc
the house is in, whether it is rented or owned, and a street address.

After this you must add each of the other rooms in the house with the
command 'housing add room', again giving the filename of the main house
room and then the filename of the room you're adding.

You can remove a house from the mapping with the 'housing remove house'
command or remove a single room from a house with 'housing remove room'.

You can set the owner of a house with 'housing owner'.  Note you can make a
house vacant with 'housing owner <house> Vacant'.

Once a house has been added to the handler, you must make it vacant, 
otherwise it will not be put up for auction.  You can do this by using 
'housing owner <house> none' to set its flag as for sale.

.SH Searching for houses
.SP 5 5
The 'housing list' and 'housing list address' commands can take a search
parameter which will be matched against the output. To invert a search
place "not" in front of the search term.

'housing list' shows the filename, renter, number of rooms and region.
'housing list address' shows the filename, address and region.

If you give the filename of a single house you will see the full details of
that house.  If you don't give any search string you will receive a list of
all the houses in the handler.
