.SH Name
.SI 5
callouts - see currently scheduled callouts
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
callouts 
callouts {before|at|after} <time> 
callouts {-c|count} 
callouts {-b|no effects} 
callouts <file> 
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The callouts command can be used to get basic information about scheduled 
callouts.
.EP

.SP 5 5
The command can be used with no arguments to display all of the currently 
scheduled callouts.  It can be given a file name to show all of the call outs
scheduled for that file, or it can be given a qualifier (before, at or after) 
and a time (in seconds) to see call outs before, at, or after that particular
time. 
.EP

.SP 5 5
There is also a brief summary mode for all objects, "count" and a "no effects"
mode, which removes effect_timer events from the call out display.  The -c and
-b tags are retained for backwards compatibility.
