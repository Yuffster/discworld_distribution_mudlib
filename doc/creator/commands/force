.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Force can be used to make another person do a command you want them to.  It is
extremely powerful and must not be used for the wrong reasons.  This power is
a priviledge of high level, not a right.  You must not use this power for your
own personal gain.  You can use it to help people, or to get them to do
something that is hard to explain.  The person you force is told who is forcing
them and what they are being force to do.  You cannot force people to kill and
you cannot force people to give.

This command is logged.  You are not encouraged to use it without good reason.
