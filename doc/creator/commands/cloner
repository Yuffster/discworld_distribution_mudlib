The cloner is what clones items on the MUD.  When an items path is

	move	This is probably the most useful command. It will rename a file (or set of files) and add a mapping entry for each one.
	add	This simply adds a mapping entry for a file.
	list	This will list the current mappings. It will take wildcard filenames as well as a substring.
	remove	This will remove a mapping
