.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to look at another players (or npcs) skill
levels.  It acts the same as the normal skills command, allowing you
to restrict the parts of the tree which it displays.

Beware, it uses find_living, so if you are using it to look
at an NPC, it will probably not be the on in the room with you if there
are multiple of the same name.
