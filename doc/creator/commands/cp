.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The cp command is used to duplicate a file.  You can copy it into a different
directory keeping the same name, or copy it to a file of a different name
anywhere.  cp will not overwrite files, so you will have to rm the file that
is already there if you want to replace an old copy of a file with a newer
one.
