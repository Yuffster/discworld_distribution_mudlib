.SH Name
.SI 5
sar - Search and replace.
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
sar <string> <string> [file(s)]
sar !<search string>! !<replace string>! <files>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Sar is used to search and replace every occurence of <search string> with 
<replace string>, in <files>.  The first usage requires for there to be no
spaces in either of the strings.  The second usage allows for spaces.  The !
can be replaced by any other character, as long as it does not occur in either
string (if ! is in either string, another character would have to be
used).  You can have carriage returns in either of the strings (handy for
inserting whole new lines) by representing them by ^M (that's caret M,
not control M).  The files can be specified using wildcards.
