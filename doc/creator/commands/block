.SP 5 5
Block by itself displays information about whether you're blocking
anything at the moment, and who you're blocking.

Block wossname@wossmud will only block messages from wossname, from
wossmud.  Block wossname will block messages from wossname from
any mud. Block wossmud will block messages from any creator at
wossmud.

NOTE: You will still be able to receive direct tells from
blocked persons on the intermud channels, as block only
keeps you from seeing their rubbish on the public channels.
