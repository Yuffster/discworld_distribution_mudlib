.SH Name

grep - Search a file for a pattern.

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
grep <regexp> <file(s)>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Grep stands for Get Regular ExPression (I think) and if it doesn't, the unix
version will take a regular expression and search files for it.  The version on
the mud also takes a regexp and tries to find all occurances of it through the
files specified.  See "man regexp" for an explanation of what a regular
expression is.

Grep is used to search through the list of files given for any occurance of 
the pattern.  Useful if you are trying to find every file which has the
word frog in it for instance.
