.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to create and keep track of a todo list.  It sorts
the todo list in priority order and by type.  The type can be anything
you wish, to help you keep your tasks more ordered.  The priority can be
any of 'VL' very low, 'L' low, 'H' high, 'VH' very high and 'U' urgent.
If you put a 'P' on the end of the priority string, then you make the
todo item private.  A private todo item can only be seen by you.
The description can be anything you wish it to be.

The id you use to complete a todo list item with is the number specified
after a # when listed.

You can also see other creators todo lists, so hopefully seeing what they are
actually working on.
