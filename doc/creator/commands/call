.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The call command allows you to call functions on objects.  This is a very
powerful command and one of the most useful debug commands.  The
function name is fairly explanitory, it is something like "short" or
"long".  If the obvar assignment is used and the result of the call
is an object pointer, then the obvar specified will now point to that
object.  The args are very flexible and I will now give you a description
of all the forms that the arguments to the functions can take.  Of course
all object references are done through wiz_present.

Numbers are of course passed as numbers, bet that surprised you :)  Strings
can take a number of forms.  Any of ', " or ` can be used to mark the
start and end of strings, it will match the two sorts of string ends.
So if you wish to have a ' in your string you can use "'s to include it.
ie "thieves' cant".  If the text is surrounded by |'s the args inside
is passed directly to wiz_present and will error if it cannot find an
object to match.  {}'s mean arrays.  So {1, 2, 3} is a array of size
3 containing the elements 1, 2, 3.  Anything of the form ob->func(args)
is replaced with the return value of the function.

The default parseing of a paramater (if it is not specificaly specified)
is to try and see if it is an object.  If this is the case it is replaced
with this, if not it is taken as a string.

Object values and return values from function calls.  If there is only
one matching object a single object is returned.  If more than one
object matches it is replaced with the array of objects.  The same
applies to return values from functions.
