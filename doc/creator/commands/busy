This command sets the busy flag for the liaison or lord.  It will tell players
and creators who tell you that you are currently busy with someone else and
that you have the message and will get back to them.  It will also
tell you every time you use tell that you have the busy flag set.  So you
hopefully cannot forget.  Every incoming tell will also be flaged with
the busy keyword.

If you set yourself as busy with a certain player then tells from
them will not be marked with the busy flag, but tells from other
people will be.
