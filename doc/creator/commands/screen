.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Screen is similar to converse in that it is useful for sending large amounts
of text to someone, however it doesn't put "X tells you:" before it, making
it useful for displaying code examples (or poetry).

Screen on/off turns your screen earmuffs on/off, and screen <name> sends text to
another creator <name>.
