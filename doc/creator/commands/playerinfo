.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The 'playerinfo' command is used to perform several functions, some of
which are duplicated by other commands.
.EP

.SI 5
1) Display a player's dossier
2) Add events to a player's dossier
3) Add and remove alts from a player's dossier
4) Handle 'alerts' (more on this below)
5) List the valid alert types
.EI

.SP 5 5
The information stored in a player's dossier is mostly useful for liaisons
who want to check the player's behavior history, punitive measures, item
replacements and so on. For each entry in the dossier the following
information is provided:
.EP

.SI 5
1) Date and time when the event was recorded
2) Type of the event
3) Name of the creator who added the entry
4) A text field describing the details of the event
.EI

.SP 5 5
Entries are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent events
coming last.  If there are more than 10 events in a player's dossier, by
default only the most recent 10 will be displayed.  You can access all the
events by using "playerinfo <playername> verbose".  If you want to display
every entry every time, you can add the "verbose playerinfo" property to
yourself with a value of 1.

You can use the "interleaved" keyword to display all events in a player's
dossier plus the events in the dossiers of every one of their alts, in
chronological order.  Each event's header will have the name of the player
in parentheses between the number and the date.
.EP

.SH Alerts
.SP 5 5
In the special case of "alert" type events, The player will show up (to
creators only) on the login inform:

> [%^GREEN%^Gumboot enters Discworld %^BOLD%^%^RED%^1 alert%^RESET%^]

This alert may then be "acknowledged". If the type is not specified, it
will go onto their dossier as a "misc" event. You can specify the type
by using this syntax:
playerinfo <playername> acknowledge <event> [as <event type>] <comment>

When you acknowledge an alert, the original information about who added
it and when, and what they said will remain, so all you need to do is
explain what you did to resolve the alert (rather than having to
paraphrase the original as well).

You can also list the players who have alerts with "playerinfo list alerts",
or list only those who have alerts and are currently online, with
"playerinfo list alerts online".

The player whose dossier is being printed doesn't have to be online. If the
optional event argument is provided, only entries of this type are printed.
