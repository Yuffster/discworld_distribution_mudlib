Name
.SI 5
find - Find where a function is defined.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
find <func> <object(s)>
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This acts similarly to 'call' but only finds out where the function is and 
doesn't call it. It tells you where the function is in the object, and
any shadows that mask the function.

note: I will get it to list *all* the incidences of the function soon--bil

Examples:
.SI 5
