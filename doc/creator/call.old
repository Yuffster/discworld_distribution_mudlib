Usage : ca*ll function(param,param,...,param) <object>

call is an interface to calling functions on objects.  It is very flexible.
The function is the name of the function you wish to call.  The parameters
to the function can be integers, strings, or objects.  The strings do not
need quotes around them unless there is an object in the room that responds
to id(string) and you want to pass the string, not the object.  Integers are
passed as integers.  Objects are specified by using a string with no quotes,
and are found by using wiz_present().  For more information on wiz_present see
/doc/creator/wiz_present().  Wiz_present is used for specifying objects in a
manner that is useful for wizards.  The <object> parameter is also specified
using wiz_present type syntax.

Examples:

call long() (pinkfish)

call add_alias(big frog) /w/shadow/frog#423

call move("/w/wibble/workroom") pinkfish

call add_exit(out,/w/furball/workroom,plain) here
