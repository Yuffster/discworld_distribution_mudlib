.SH How to use the interview room
.SP 5 5
The domain interview room centralises all the functionality you're likely to 
need when interviewing players for creator positions.  It contains an automated
lecture on creator responsibilities, and logging facilities for interviews.  It 
also handles sending out creator tests and confirming receipt of any submissions.

First, a player is added to the room data by using the 'add <name> [as candidate]
syntax.  This will send out a copy of the application test.  Once you have
recieved their submission, you can 'confirm <name>' to send out a mail indicating
that you have received it.  If you have set confirmation text within your room,
this will be sent in a mail to the player.  Otherwise, a default message will
be sent.  'query confirmation [text]' will show you the confirmation message.

When interviewing a player, first the automated lecture should be shown.

The 'show movie' command will start playing the automated lecture.  Once this
is completed and the player still wishes to continue their application, you 
can 'interview <player>' to begin logging.  Only says and souls are logged.  

Once an interview has been completed, you can 'end interview' to stop logging.
Log files are stored in the set interview directory under the name of the
interviewed player... for example, /d/your_domain/secure/interviews/drakkos.txt.

You may query the state of your applications using the 'query applicants' 
command.  This will return the relevant information for who the candidates are
and what stage of the process they are at. 

By default, only the domain lord and the domain deputies may use the room.  
The lord of the domain may allow other creators to conduct interviews and
so on by using the 'grant [access to] <name>' syntax.  Access can later be
removed by using the 'remove <name> [as allowed]' syntax.

Candidates can be removed from the room using 'clear all candidates' if
the information is to be completely cleared, or 'delete <name>' if a
particular name is to be removed.

To mark a particular candidate as accepted or rejected, the flag command
is used.  This will send a form mail to the candidate.  The interview 
room sets default mail messages (which can be seen by using 
'query acceptance text' and 'query rejection text').  These can be
over-ridden in your own domain room.

Finally, you can read the interview for a particular player by using the
'read interview for <name>' command.  The list of available player files
is given using 'list interviews'
