Usage : wizlist [ALL]

Wizlist is a command that shows how many commands have been executed on objects
belonging to certain groups.  The optional ALL parameter forces wizlist to print
all of the groups, rather than the default top 10 or so and the ones surrounding
the group you are in.

The meaning of each of the fields is as follows:-
first column     - group name
second column    - commands done
third column     - percentage of total commands
fourth column    - ranking
fifth column     - number of evaluated nodes of LPC code
sixth column     - Heartbeats evaluated in area
seventh column   - Total exp/money given out
eighth column    - number of array elements being used
