The creator help file would be rather long, so we've split it into three files.

edit     info      manipulation

'help edit' will get you the edit file, 'help info' will get you the info
file, and so on.  Keep in mind that each of the commands listed in each
of the files has its own help file in turn, accessible via 'help'.  So
'help goto' will return the help file on the command 'goto'.  All help
files as well as all kinds of lengthier documentation are located in
/doc.  Read through /doc for further information.
