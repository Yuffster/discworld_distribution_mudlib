Quests should be designed to be blatantly single player, or team oriented.
Team oriented quests are by far the more desirable.

When a person or people finish a quest, you need only call

#include "library.h"

and

LIBRARY->set_quest("player name", "quest name");

After you have done this, the player will be recorded as having done
this quest.  That function returns 1 if it is the first time they have
done the quest.  Do not reward players for redoing a quest.
