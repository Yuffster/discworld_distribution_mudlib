Usage: You can't from inside the mud.

This is a method by which you can get files to and from the mud so that
you can edit them locally (safe from 'ed'!). The method you use is to
ftp to a ftp daemon here and there you will have access to your directory.

To find out how to use ftp type 'man ftp' on your local unix machine.

You login as your creator character, with its password. 
anonymous ftp is NOT supported.

The address for ftp'ing to the Discworld is:
