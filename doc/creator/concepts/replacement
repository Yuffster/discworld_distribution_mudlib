replacing items for players

Description
.SP 5 5
Losing items due to various causes is unfortunately a fact of life.  It
is necessary to have rules concerning replacement by which all creators
abide, since players will always find those creators who are less strict
or more generous and have items replaced by them.  In the case that a
player holds a receipt, the item on the receipt can be replaced.  If
there is no receipt, and the player's claim is credible, items can be
replaced if they were lost due to a plausible bug or due to a crash;
items should not be replaced if they were in the player's corpse and
then something happened either to them or to the corpse (other than a crash or bug causing the corpse to be lost).

In the absence of a receipt, not all items are to be replaced, and those
that may be replaced come in one of two categories (which may change
over time to reflect changes in the game).  The first category, "tricky"
items, should only be replaced to players below level 120; beyond this
level, they should be capable of obtaining the items for themselves.  The
second category, "hard" items, can be replaced to players at all
levels.  These lists can be found towards the end of this file, many of
the items on them being on Presto's wand.  Enchantment and other special
enhancements on items are not replaced.

As far as money in concerned, only amounts up to A$30 (12000 brass coins)
should be replaced; this may seem harsh, but there are banks and other
storage facilities available.  For experience, Liaison creators and
Lords _only_ may replace up to 500xp per guild level.

Anything replaced that didn't have a receipt should be mentioned on the
"playerhelp" board in order that other creators know what happened -
this is particularly true of replacing experience.
