Dwclone

.SH Name
.SI 5
Dwclone - A clone of discworld for creator use only.
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Coding creators have to deal with two problems beyond bugs in their code
and learning new methods: distractions from their coding and
worrying about what damage their code might do to players.
.EP
.SP 5 5
This is where dwclone comes in: it is an almost perfect clone of
discworld, with some very important differences:
.EP
.SP 5 5
1. There are no players.  This means that you can test
code there that might crash the mud without fear of
burdening the liaisons with the cleanup for your snafus.
However, that also means that if you want to test something
on a player, you have to create you own test players.
.EP
.SP 5 5
2.  Certain debugging features have been enabled in the mud
driver, to make it easier to catch some types of problems.
These features will make their presence known through 
slightly different error and warning messages when your
code runs.  In fact, it could very well be that some of
your code that will run without complainct on the real mud
will produce warnings on the clone: don't ignore those
warnings, they more than likely indicate bugs that will be very hard
to track down on the live discworld.
.EP
.SP 5 5
3.  Many fixed limits have been lowered, sometimes significantly,
in order to make careless code break faster.  One prime
example is the size of an array (or mapping): on both the
live mud and on dwclone, there is a maximum number of
elements that an array (or mapping) may contain.  If you
exceed that size, the whole mud will crash.  These sizes are
available to your code, and you should check them at run
time.  This was the cause of the infamous "grep in
/logs" bug.  This size has been lowered on the dwclone,
so if your code doesn't check for that occurrance, and 
properly handle it, it will crash.
.EP
.SP 5 5
4.  The boards and mailer don't work.  Actually, they work just fine, but
some index files are wrong, so you'll see things like a message
saying there are 30 new messages on the board, but
find them all blank.  You can still test things that
use the boards or mailer, but just be aware of this screwiness.
.EP

.SH Where is dwclone?
.SP 5 5
Dwclone has been known to change it's IP address on a highly
irregular basis.  At any time, you can find its current
IP address by logging into discworld and using 'mudlist dwclone'.
This command will list out all the current information
about dwclone.  Dwclone rarely changes IP address unnanounced, however.
If you can't get on to dwclone, your first step is to log on
to discworld, and issue the above mudlist command.
.EP

.SH How to get more help
.SP 5 5
Updates on dwclone were previously posted to the development
board.  Now they are posted to the dwclone club board.  This is where
all known outages, IP address changes, and other updates will be
posted.  If you have a dwclone account, it's in your best
interests to read dwclone board on a regular basis.
.EP
.SP 5 5
If you need more help, ask one of the dwclone managers online.
The managers are listed when you 'finger dwclone'.
These managers are all empowered with complete access to
dwclone, and can do anything needed to get dwclone fixed up, or
pass out information as they see fit.  Of course, these managers
are creators in their own rights, and have duties outside
of being a dwclone manager.  If they're busy when you approach
them, then they're busy.  Try again significantly later,
or ask one of the other managers.
.EP

.SH How to get an account
.SP 5 5
Before you can use dwclone, you have to get an account on it.
The process is similar to getting your first account on discworld,
with some special differences.
.EP
.SP 5 5
Since you're reading this, you're a creator here on discworld.
Your character on dwclone _must_ have the same name as your
creator here.
.EP
.SP 5 5
Log on some time and catch one of the dwclone managers online.
Tell him that you want a dwclone account.  If he's not busy
he'll get your current IP address, and open up dwclone so you can
create a new character with that same name.  You'll start off
just like when you were a newbie charcter, in the newbie area.
You'll need to complete the womble's brooch quest before
we can proceed.  Then the manager (who will be logged into the clone
during this time) will employ you.  You must then log out and
log back in.  Poof!  Now you're a dwclone creator.  If you want
any test characters, you'll have to create them right then and
age them so they don't autodelete.  Within 24 hours of
getting your dwclone account, you will no longer be able
to create new characters, without asking one of the dwclone
managers for help.
.EP
.SP 5 5
You'll notice that creating a new character depends on the
manager knowing your IP address.  Some of you connect to
the Internet using ISPs who only assign dynamic IP addresses,
so you have a different IP address every time you log in.  This
isn't a problem as long as you remember to keep your connection
going from the time that you ask a dwclone manager for an account
and the time that you create your characters.  Once you
have created your characters, you can log in from any IP address.
.EP

.SH Synchronization and File Transfer
.SP 5 5
The clone is automatically synchronized every Sunday night (PST).
When the synchronization occurs, every file on discworld that is
newer than the same file on the clone will be replaced.  The
exception is that none of the files in /w or /logs are
synchronized, and only some of the files in /save are
synchronized.  There are also some files which, while being subject
are synchronization, are necessarily different on the clone as
compared to the real discworld.  These files get automatically
patched with every synchronization.
.EP
.SP 5 5
If you want to synchronize files in your home directory, you'll have
to do it by hand.  FTP works to the clone just as it works to discworld,
and you can FTP all your files to or from the clone as you
would expect.  Of course, you need an account on the
clone to FTP to it.  See above.
.EP
.SH Rules
.SP 5 5
Access to dwclone is only given to _current_ discworld creators:
if you lose your discworld account, you lose your dwclone
account.
.EP
.SP 5 5
All rules that apply to creators on discworld also apply to them on
dwclone.
The one exception, of course, is that you can be much more free about
code that might crash the mud.
.EP
.SP 5 5
The access you have on dwclone is the same as the access you have
on discworld.  If you want to have more access on dwclone, get your
domain lord to ask a dwclone manager for permission.  In any case, the
extra access will only last until the next Sunday night synchronization.
If you need your access beyond that time, ask again.
