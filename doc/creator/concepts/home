Usage : home

Home is obsolete.  With the built in aliases, it was decided that it was more
flexible to let you alias home to take you where ever you wanted.  To give
yourself a home command, type

alias home goto /w/<yourname>/workroom

or if you want your workroom to be elsewhere, just make it take you somewhere
else, eg

alias home goto /room/death/bathroom
