Alignment            Discworld Creator Help                Alignment

Background:
  Players and non-playing characters (monsters) all have moral
  alignments.  By killing good monsters, you will become evil and vice
  versa.

Alignment help :  Brandobas 26.5.93
       Changed :  Sin 16.12.97 Fixed so agrees with align_string()
       Changed :  Sin 20.12.97 Fixed so agrees with new align_string() :)

This is how the numbers you get from query_al() compare with the
titles you get on the who list and also as an aid to decide what
alignment you should give to NPCs.

  al < -5000      "extremely good"
  al < -2500      "very good"
  al < -1250      "quite good"
  al < -600       "good"
  al < -300       "barely good"

  -300 < al < 300 "neutral"

  al > 300        "barely evil"
  al > 600        "evil"
  al > 1250       "quite evil"
  al > 2500       "very evil"
  al > 5000       "extremely evil"
