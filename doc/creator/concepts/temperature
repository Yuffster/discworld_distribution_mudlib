temperature

Description
.SP 5 5
The temperature of locations on Discworld is primarily controlled by
the weather system.  However, inside locations (unless modified) all
have a temperature of 20C (64F). You can increase or decrease this in
1C increments by use of the "warmth" property.

The "warmth" property can be used on clothing to cause them to warm or
cool their wearer. Unless the item is magical never go above +3 or
below -3 for this property on an item of clothing.
