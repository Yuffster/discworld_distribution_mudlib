Liaison Policy
Multiplaying


For the rules on multiplaying, see 'help multiplechars'.  Briefly, it is against the rules for any player to use one of their characters to help another in any way, or to have two logged on at once.  To comply with the rules, players from one IP must set valid email addresses, and contact a liaison.

.SH Spying with Rays
.SP 5 5
We have several methods for detecting and assessing multiplaying: duplicate informs, swapped item informs, the arcane instrument, finger and playerinfo, etc.  All of these methods are open to abuse, and so should %^BOLD%^not%^RESET%^ be advertised to players.  Tell players 'both players need to log on at once for further discussion and investigation' and not 'both players need to log on and get charted'.  For the same reason, if something very inconsequential is swapped via a third party ([%^RED%^Wyvette got a carrot from Wyvster via Kaeatest%^RESET%^]), it may be best to note it in PI in case they repeat the process, rather than approach them with your 'important discovery'.

.SH Networks
.SP 5 5
Before a player logs in with another person from the same network, they should contact a liaison to warn them about this.  Players seldom do this, but do encourage it.
.EP

.SP 5 5
If two people do log on from the same IP, use the arcane instrument to chart them together to monitor their idle times.  Also check playerinfos and compare their finger info - look for same birthdays, same real names, same email address etc.  If either do not have email addresses set, ask them to do so.  Ask the players about why they are logged on together.  If possible, do not say who else is logged on from the same place, for privacy reasons.  Avoid multitells for this reason.
.EP

.SO 2 3 70
	*	If their chart is good, they have different email addresses set and you are happy that they are different people from talking to them, add them as allowed and post to playerhelp.

	*	If they do not seem to be different people, ask them if they are alts.  If they still insist they are not, add to playerinfo but do not add as allowed.

	*	If they admit to being alts, tell them to log one character off and ask them to read 'help multiplechars'.
.EO

.SP 5 5
If items are passed between the two characters, chart, check info and check where both characters are (if they're logged in still), and then check the current results from the chart (preferably this will have already started before they pass items).  Then chat to them both, using your index of suspicion as a guide to how you approach them:
.EP

.SO 2 3 70
	*	If you are happy they are different people, add them as allowed.

	*	If you're not sure, chart for longer and try getting another liaison to chat to the other player and watch the chart then.

	*	If they admit to being alts, ask them to give you all the stuff that was passed (item swapping informs are logged in /log/MULTIPLAYING), dest the items and warn that they will be suspended.  Add both players as gits ('multiplayer add git kaea') and add a multiplay event to both to say who they multiplayed with and how, and post to discipline.
.EO

.SP 5 5
If multiplaying is done with one of the characters offline (eg. using mail, burying items then su-ing and recovering etc) then talk to the online player.  

If they log off, add alerts to both players including what items were passed and whether you spoke to them.
.EP

.SH Two players from one computer
.SP 5 5
The rules state that you may not share a keyboard between two characters.  However, it is less clear what to do if the two players are swapping items by using the computer alternately.  In this case, ask them if the other player can log back on from a different computer at the same time as them.  If they cannot, ask them not to pass items between them from the same computer and dest the stuff since they cannot prove they're not multiplaying.  If they can then they must be charted and chatted to together.  If this cannot be done immediately, confiscate the swapped items and leave them in the bookcase in your workroom for another liaison to return if the players play again together in the immediate future.  Add alerts to both players.

.SH Money
.SP 5 5
If someone multiplays money, you don't need to spend time worrying how much, you can 'dest coins in <player>'.  :P  If they have spent it on items, dest those items instead.  If they have sold items for money, dest the money.
.EP 5 5

.SH Refreshing
.SP 5 5
Players must not pick items up after a refresh, or ask other players to hold their stuff.  If they do this, the items must be dested, add a playerinfo event and warn them that they may be suspended.  Ask them to read help refresh.
.EP

.SH Punishments
.SP 5 5
A first multiplaying offense will normally earn a suspension of 2 weeks.  Punishments become more severe when players have multiplayed before.  The Lord of Liaison and Deputies will deal with punishing multiplayers after it has been posted on the discipline board.
.EP

.SH Notes
.SP 5 5
Note that all the above are subject to judgement and discretion.  If a player accidentally picks up a dagger dropped by their alt, if was probably accidental and should be dested and the player reminded of the rules only.  Always remember to post to either playerhelp or discipline.  However, remember that ignorance of the rules is not an excuse.  Nor is 'testing' our systems.

There is generally nothing to be lost by watching and waiting (and charting) a little.  If they swap one item, they may be about to swap a whole lot - wait and see.  The exceptions are containers, which you should inv immediately, to make sure all items are found once you approach.

CCAAA is an abbreviation common on the playerhelp board: Charted, Chatted, Added as Allowed.  Please also include any extra information in your posts, such as 'they're brothers', 'they're on from a library network', 'they have registered their alts, and have promised to talk to a liaison', etc.
