.SH Summary
.SP 5 5
SLUR (short for Scripting Language Useful for Rooms) is a utility created
to take large amounts of grunt-work coding out of making "plays" or
"routines" for the players.  Additionally, these scripts are designed from
the very start to allow for branching or otherwise non-linear progression
through the script.  Nothing is as delightful to a player than to discover
something new and exciting about a boring old task he had to do out of
necessity, even if it does mean that his character loses a finger.  Of
course, you don't have to tell the players that you just added in a random
or skill-based possibility of hitting the Lose-A-Finger routine just the
other day when they weren't looking.

Slur is designed to look and behave a bit like a cousin of Lisp whose mother drank during the pregnancy.
