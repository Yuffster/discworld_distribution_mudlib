               -- Guidelines for discworld creators --

The way mud admin works at the moment is a fairly simple heirarchy.
At the top are the trustees, who are general maintenance/dispute
resolving/creator-thumping people.  Then there are the domain 
leaders who have the rank of 'director'.  There are also other 
directors, who do not actively manage a domain.  At the moment there are 
serveral working domains (am, forn, sur, ram, klatch,
guilds, liaison, underworld, waterways and cwc).
 
    Each domain covers a certain area of land :-

    'am' covers the city of Ankh-Morpork.
    'sur' covers the surrounding forests and plains.
    'ram' covers the Ramtop mountains.
    'klatch' covers the desert continent across the sea.
    'cwc' covers the Counter Weight Continent.
    'forn' covers various Forn Parts, such as Genua and Llamedos.
    'guilds' covers the guild houses, and cause of most bugs.
    'underworld' covers the cross-dimensional areas that sometimes 
              converge on Discworld. 
    'liaison' are the liaisons between players and the administration 
              and help players when there are problems/bugs.
    'waterways' covers all the waters of the Disc.

    Domain leaders obviously control all development in a particular domain.
    They also are responsible for employing and dismissing creators within
    their domain.  Each domain usually has at least one domain deputy who is next
    in the line of chain of command if there are questions or help needed.
    These folks have been given that responsibility for their skills, talents,
    dedication as well as the ability to help manage the domain.  Feel free to
    talk to them just as easily as your domain leader.

1st week.  Read as many documents as you can.  Attempt to modify your creator
           room and get familiar with the basics.  Do not try to create the
           massively powerful, insta-kill weapon.  For heaven's sake, don't
           forget your manners.

2nd week.  Try to do up the newbie coding project assigned by your domain 
           leader or deputies.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, and keep 
           reading.

3rd & 4th week Keep plugging away.  Ask your leader or one of the deputies 
          to check your work.  Try to keep in theme with Discworld as it 
          is difficult to know what kind of assignments you would like to 
          do if you have mutant dragons when you're working in an area where 
          there will never be dragons (mutant or otherwise).


Domain leaders are pretty busy, and it may seem like you never get to speak
to them.  They were newbies once, and they know what its like, and will
do their best to get to you as soon as they can.  

Many creators turn up, make that massively powerful insta-kill weapon
and disrupt everyone for a few days and then vanish.  Sometimes this
is because they are not expecting that it isn't as easy as it looks.
Perhaps it is also due to the pressure of trying to learn as much as
you can as soon as you can.  Don't be discouraged by lack of progress.
It takes time.


==========================================================================

               -- Things which are *not* acceptable --

1) Interaction with players in ANY WAY related to the game.  Giving out
information, money, equipment, skills, xp, or generally giving an unfair
advantage to a player(s), is forbidden.  This does not apply to the
liaison guidelines, but the Leader of Liaison will handle that with liaison
creators.  Chatting with players is fine, but harrassing, and generally
making a nuisance of yourself is not acceptable.

2) Use of echoto, echoall, emoteall without a very good reason, is
considered to be abuse of those commands, and it is logged.  Making
items that do the same thing will cause Pinkfish to get most upset
and you will be dismissed.  Use these command wisely.
Also the use of meteors, and other commands that affect a player
are not acceptable use.  They are also logged and again, making
an item to circumvent this will be causal for dismissal.

3) Breaking file system security is of course considered rather rude.
Attempting to do so is _also_ considered rude.

4) General courtesy is expected of you.  We would hesitate many times
before banishing a player for making a nuisance of him/herself, however we
are less worried about doing the same to you as a creator.  Hassling other
creators/players, shouting continuously and (particularly) emote-raping are
right out.

5) Becoming a creator is for creating, not law-enforcing.  That is
what the liaisons, directors and trustees are for.  Some creators think
that their job is to try to keep players/creators in line, but this is
neither helpful nor appropriate.  If there comes a time when players 
complain that another player is being unpleasant/unsociable/generally 
breaking the player guidelines, refer it to a liaison.

In no particular order:

Trustees:
   Pinkfish, Ceres, Turrican, Sojan, Wodan, Taffyd, and Hobbes.

There are others, but they are less likely to be around.

Domain Leaders:
   Sasquatch, Una, Danbala, Jeremy, Dasquian, Wyvyrn, Sojan, 
   Dogbolter, Carmine and Drakkos. 

Other Directors: 
   Magpie, Gruper, and Ohdamn.

If none of the above are on, then use a bit of discretion.  Warn the
player first.  If she/he continues, either force them to quit as a shock
tactic or put a shout curse on them as appropriate.  More you cannot do.
Remember, this is all as a last resort in the case where a player is being
supremely annoying/disruptive, and there are no directors around.
If creators are causing a problem then there is obviously not much you can
do.  Talk to them, and mail a trustee about the situation.

As a new creator, it is best to spend your time invis rather than to be
available to players.  You are not going to be familiar with the rules
of replacement for lost items nor are you going to have the answers to 
the insurmountable questions that are going to be coming at you as you
will appear in the listing of online creators if you are visible.
Do not attempt to liaise, it is not your responsibility if you are not
in the liaison domain, and it is easier on all if you are not available.

Good luck!
