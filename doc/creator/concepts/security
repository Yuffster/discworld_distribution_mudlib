Discworld MUD's Creator Security Policy
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Being a Creator on Discworld is a big responsibility. Detailed information
about players and other creators is accessable with a single command.  Any
information that you read is strictly confidential. 
.EP

.SP 5 5
This includes information from creator informs, telling players the email 
addresses
of other players or creators when they have specifically chosen not to have 
this information visible, and IP address information from commands like 
netstat.  The policy also extends to information that you read on a creator
board about another player or see in the playerinfo command.

.SP 5 5 
Most importantly, the Discworld mudlib is not a public release.  Only a small
restricted number of people are allowed complete access to the mudlib, these
are normally Creators who have shown that they are trustworthy and committed
to the development of the MUD.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Leaking code from the MUD to other MUDs or making it public for download can
be grounds for instant dismissal and/or worse.  You don't want to know about
the worse.  If you want to download an archive of the MUD's documentation,
then this can be downloaded from /doc/doc.tar.gz

If you have any questions about the MUD's security policy then please mail
either your domain Lord or an Administrator.
