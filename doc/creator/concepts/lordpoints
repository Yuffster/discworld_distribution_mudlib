Lord Points

.SH Name

lord points - scoring system  
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Lord points are an interesting facet of being a creator.  They are mysterious...
elusive.  Granted to the people who have shown talent and exceptional ability
in the fields of:
.EP

.SO 5 5 -20
	a)	creative use of code
	b)	use of undocumented features in the mudlib and driver
	c)	inventive interaction between objects
.EO

.SP 5 5
We are more interested in these three points than in any of the side effects.
For example, it doesn't matter if the code works.  It doesn't matter if it
lags the disc to hell and back.  It doesn't even matter if it crashes the
Disc.  But there are a number of modifiers that are used to ensure that the
correct distribution of Lord Points are granted.  
.EP


.SH Scoring Chart
.SP 5 5
First, we start with a cumulative scale:
.EP

.SO 5 7 -20
	0	Normal code. 
	1	Code that lags the MUD solid for an hour or two
	2	Code that breaks something important or commonly used.
	2	Code that crashes the MUD.
	3	Code that requires the MUD be shut down RIGHT THIS FREAKING SECOND!!!
	3	Code that breaks something important enough to make the MUD unplayable
	4	Code that requires players to be restored from a backup
	5	Code that requires creators to be restored from a backup
	6	Code that worked fine while the MUD was running, but broke come the next reboot.
	6	Code that requires Lords to be restored from a backup
	7	Code that requires High Lords to be restored from a backup
	8	Code that requires Pinkfish to be restored from a backup
	9	Code that requires the whole MUD being restored from a backup
	10	Code that requires the whole internet being restored from a backup.
.EO

.SP 5 5
Note that this is cumulative... so if you wrote code that lagged the MUD solid
for an hour, then made it crash, you would get 3 lord points.  If you wrote
code that required the MUD to be shut down instantly, and then required players
to be restored from backup, you'd get 7 points.  
.EP

.SH Percentage Modifiers
.SP 5 5
Further to this, there are percentage modifiers that are applied to ensure that
we have a proper method of rewarding creative use of code, rounding up.  These
are also cumulative:
.EP

.SO 5 7 -20
	+25%	If your fix to the code caused another effect that qualifies for lord points. For example, in fixing a crasher, you introduce an effect that lags the MUD for the rest of the day.  Not only to you get the 2 points for the crash, you get another point for lagging the Disc (plus the point for the lag), giving a total of 4 shiny lord points.
	+25%	If the object you break is required to be in perfect working order before you can fix it.  For example, if a lord breaks his/her domain master object.
	+50%	If any attempt to reboot the MUD triggered the effect... code in, for example, the player object or the master object is good for this.
	+50%	If the action you did to get the lord points is entirely inconsistent with the effect... for example, calling move on an object.
	+50%	If you needed to go begging to someone to get it fixed.
	+100%	For being very, very, very funny.
	+100%	If you're already a Lord and no longer require the points.
	-100%	If the effect was intentional.  You will also be crucified for this.  :-P
	-100%	If what you did was mind-numbingly irresponsible.
