Description
.SP 5 5
Lords are the administrators of the Discworld MUD.  The job of most creators
is to write code and to fix bugs and the job of the Lords are to make sure
this happens.

To administer your domain, you have several commands, some defined in your
player object (/global/lord) and some in the nice domain control room, 
/d/admin/room/domain_control, which you use to add creators to your domain,
remove them from your domain and when they are members of your domain you can
also define a project, which is the message showing up in their finger
information.

.EP

The commands defined in /global/lord are:
.SI 5
employ <name>
.EI
.SP 10 5
This will make <name> a creator, saving a copy of the save-file, and mailing
the files /doc/creator/concepts/creator_doc.txt and
/doc/creator/concepts/project_style.txt to the new creator.
.EP
.SP 10 5
Note that if you get a message about "Player file has already been backed
up." the player hasn't been employed, and is still a player.  To fix this
situation you have to delete the file "/save/creators/name.o", then
use the employ command again.

General guidelines
.SP 5 5
You are a Lord to make sure your domain thrives; this means you have to make
sure that the creators in your domain know what they are supposed to work
on, and that you should check regularly to see if they have any problems
getting it done, and that they actually do work on it.
.EP
.SP 5 5
If they don't, it's your duty to check why, and if they aren't going to
continue working, you should see if it's a general problem or they'd be more
productive in another domain.  If it's general, you should dismiss the
creator, otherwise talk to the Lord of the other domain and see it that's a
solution that will work.
.EP
.SP 5 5
Note that this means that if you have other Lords or High Lords as members of
your domain, it's your decision if they should continue being members, and
you should use the same standards to decide as used for creators.
.EP

Employing newbie creators
.SP 5 5
This should only be done by Lords who have projects that are easily done by new
creators, eg. simple alleys, which checks descriptive powers more that
coding skills, and only by Lords who have the time to teach coding to the
new creator.  In practice this currently means that 'am' gets most new
creators.
.EP
.SP 5 5
NB.  This doesn't include liaison where the creators aren't employed to code,
but to help players.
