Tasks - Processes used to develop skills by using those skills
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
A task is an action that can be attempted by a player, the success 
or failure of the attempt being determined by the difficulty of the
task compared with the player's bonuses for some relevant set of
skills.  If the attempt succeeds but could have failed, there is a
chance that the player is rewarded with a level in one or more of
the skills used in attempting the task.

Implementation
.SP 5 5
The difficulty of the task is the skill bonus at which the player first
stands a chance of succeeding - below this bonus the attempt will always
fail.  There is then some margin above this difficulty where failure is
still possible, but with the chance of failure falling off as the
player's bonus increases.  Above this margin, the player has mastered
this particular task and any attempt will always succeed.  A graph of
the probability of succeeding at an attempt of the task versus the
player's bonus would look like:

The possibility of gaining a level from performing the task comes
in the margin where the attempt could succeed or fail.  A graph
of the chance of gaining a level versus the player's bonus would
look like:
