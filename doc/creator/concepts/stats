Description
.SP 5 5
This is a general help on all the stat functions.  There are too many
stats for this to be done in a more useful fashion.  There are 5 stats
namely, Strength, Dexterity, Consitition, Wisdom and Inteligence.

Of each of these stats there are 3 parts.  One part is the basic part,
or the natural part of the stat.  This value is saved and can only
range from 0-28.  The second part is the bonus value.  This is the value
gained from races and certain items.  This value is not saved and
can have any value.  The other one is the temporary value.  The
temporary value is halved every 15 minutes.  This is saved and
can also have any value.

The natural value of a stat should be very rarely changed.  The times
when it is changed should be when you rearrange the stats and when
you complete some really hard quest.  So, if you create a sword that
gives somone a great strength when they are wielding it, don't play
with this value.  Use the bonus value of the stat.

The bonus values are used for things like stat bonus's from races and
for stat changes from things like swords or thingys like that.  Remember
this is NOT saved.  So this is most useful for bonuses from things
like items you are carrying.

The temporary value of a stat should be used for things like potions.
This gives an effect that slowly wears off.

Each of the stat values have three functions available for them.
Setting them, querying them and adjusting them.  The main query's
ie query_str, query_con, query_dex, query_wis and query_int are
actually the composite value gained from adding all of the stat parts
together.  To get at the real values, use the query_real set.

When a stat is changed certain values that rely on it need to be
changed.  One of the functions that is called is zap_stat_cache
with a one letter string being the id of the stat being changed passed
as a paramater.

The other function called for each stat.

There are two other function related to this.  set_no_check and
query_no_check.  These are set and queryed for the no_set variable.
If this variable is set then the extra functions are not called when
the stat is changed.  This is used in the setting up of a monster so
that the expensive routines for calculating hps and so on were not
called more than once.

Function reference:

This returns the composite value of the stats:
query_str, query_dex, query_int, query_wis, query_con


Values for working on the "natural" values:
set_str, set_dex, set_int, set_wis, set_con

query_real_str, query_real_dex, query_real_int, query_real_wis, query_real_con

adjust_str, adjust_dex, adjust_int, adjust_wis, adjust_con


Functions for adjusting the bonus stats:
set_bonus_str, set_bonus_dex, set_bonus_int, set_bonus_wis, set_bonus_con
	
query_bonus_str, query_bonus_dex, query_bonus_int, query_bonus_wis, query_bonus_con
	
adjust_bonus_str, adjust_bonus_dex, adjust_bonus_int, adjust_bonus_wis, adjust_bonus_con


Functions for adjusting the bonus stats:
set_tmp_str, set_tmp_dex, set_tmp_int, set_tmp_wis, set_tmp_con
	
query_tmp_str, query_tmp_dex, query_tmp_int, query_tmp_wis, query_tmp_con
