Description
.SP 5 5
Virtual objects and rooms (Vobjects) are objects that are cloned from a
base object, and then configured.  This is similar to what is done with
#inherited objects.  The only thing is that the Vobject can not contain
it's own functions.  All configuration is done by call_other()'s on
the cloned object.  Although this uses more cpu cycles, it saves on
memory, which is considered by many as a good thing.  Currently there
are 6 types of Vobjects: armor, weapon, object, room, monster, and
'other'.

.SP 5 5
The different type of objects are determined by the extension of
the file, ie: .arm, .clo, .wep, .ob, .r, .mon.  The 'other' type of Vobject
is made from one of the 6 standard types (explained below).
.EP
 
.SP 5 5
Vobject files are made from comment lines (yes! comment them!) and
config lines.  Comment lines start with '#'.  Config lines start with
'::'.

Example 1:
 
# Start of example.ob
#
::#debug:: 0
::name:: "man"
::short:: "A virtual test monster (a cyberbot)"
::long:: "A virtual test monster other wise known as a cyberbot.
 It was made to test the virtual compiler.\n"
::alias:: "monster"
::alias:: "bot"
::race:: "human"
::move zone:: "cyber space"
::main_plural:: "virtual test monsters (cyberbots)"
 
 
  Explanation:
.SP 5 5
The # lines are comment lines.  Keywords that start with
'#' (ie the line "::#debug:: 0") are Vobject compiler switches.  The
other lines are fairly straight forward.  ::name:: sets the name of the
object to "man".
.EP
 
  Vobject keywords:
.SP 5 5
Current Vobject keywords are: #debug, #include and #class.  If #debug
is set to 1, then the temporary file will not be removed if there is an
error in it.  #include allows you to include a standard .h file from
/include.  #class will set the base object to be cloned (explained below).

For a list of current 'standard' keywords, check the file
"/global/virtual/compiler.h".  Different object types have different keywords.

Other Vobjects:
.SP 5 5
Any other object that can be cloned and configured can be made into a
Vobject.  To do that, use the compiler switch "$class" and give the
absolute path to the base object.  Functions that are defined in a
new Vobject class that aren't a standard function can be called using
the '$' escape char giving the full function name.

Example 2:
 
# This room works, so #debug can be removed, or set to 0
::#Debug:: 0
 
# Use a 'non-standard' base object for cloning.
::#Class:: "/std/outside.c"
 
::Long:: "This is a virtual test room - long description.\n"
 
# The $ start char is used for functions that are not defined
# in the virtual object compiler
::$set_night_long:: "This is a virtual test room (at night) -
 long description.\n"
 
# Now setup the short, exit, co ords, and light level
::Short:: "Virtual test room"
::light::100
 
# silly co ord's to give, but they work for the demo.  Note: all
# out door rooms must have co ords, either set via set_co_ord
# (::co ord::), or the room must be loaded from a room with co ords.
::co ord:: ({ 0, 0, 0 })
 
 
  Explanation:
.SP 5 5
The "::$set_night_long:: ....." line will setup a call to
set_night_long() using the argument given.
.EP
 
 
Hint:
.SP 5 5
To see how the Vcompiler will format the temp file, leave off
an ending quote mark and set $debug to 1.  This will make the temporary .c file
crash, and the compiler will not remove the errant file.  Be sure to remove
the file as soon as you are done looking at it so we don't use too much
file space.
