A Simple Guide to Fixing Bugs.

.SH Introduction

.SP 5 5                        
A lot of people avoid the fixing of simple bugs in their domains
because they think it is more difficult than it really is, they don't
really understand how to do it, or they are not sure how to use RCS.
.EP

.SP 5 5 
This file is designed to be a simple walkthrough of how to fix bugs
in your domain.  There is no place to hide; by typing fixed <creator> you
can see how many bugs have been fixed by each creator.The total numbers of 
bugs fixed by everyone can be seen by typing 'fixed all'.
.EP

.SH Locating Bugs

.SP 5 5
There are two ways to start.  The first way is to use finderrors,
which has its own helpfile in case you get confused.  Finderrors will
allow you to add directories to a list and then check that list for error
reports. 
.EP

.SP 5 5
To use finderrors, you must first add the directories you want to the
list.  To do this, type "finderrors add <directory name>".  For example,
"finderrors add /d/ram/*" would add all of the Ram domain to your list.  
Then type "finderrors" to take you to an error.  The command "finderrors
count" will list all of the errors in the directories you chose and give
you a total.  For more detailed finderrors help, see the helpfile.
.EP

.SP 5 5
The other way to do it is to go to the relevant error tracker, posted
on domain boards weekly.  It should look something like the following:
.EP

.SP 5 5  
Title: "Error summaries for Ram"

There are reports in the following directories in Ram
.EP

.SO 67 -5

     12    3    2  TOTAL
.EO

.SP 5 5
Go to the relevant directory using the cd command.  (For
example, "cd /d/ram/chars".)  Then type "errors" to bring up the bug
report for that directory.  Or, alternatively, "errors <directory>" will
work just as well.
.EP

.SP 5 5
A bug, typo or idea report will show up in the following format:
.EP

.SO 52 -5
     ROOM TYPO 
     /d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c

.EO

.SP 5 5
Once you have read the error report, it is always a good idea to go
to the location of the bug or typo mentioned in the report to check it
out.  If you determine it needs fixing, you must unlock the file using
RCS.  (You cannot modify a file on RCS without unlocking it first.)  
Please note: RCS has an excellent helpfile.
.EP

.SP 5 5
To unlock an RCS file, type "rcsout <file pathname>".  For example,
rcsout /d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c would unlock the file to you.  Only
you can edit that file until you put it back.  This gives you access to
fix the file, which can be fixed using ftp or ed, depending on your
preference.  You must have write access to the file to be able to rcsout it 
however.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Using rcsout should return something close to the following:
.EP

.SO 76 -5
     >rcsout /d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c
     d/ram/ohulan/market/RCS/market_c.c,v --> d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c.c
     revision 1.2 (locked)
     done
.EO

.SP 5 5
Then fix the typo in the normal way and update the room to make sure
it works.  Please remember to check the room for objects that might be
destroyed or similar situations before updating.
.EP

.SP 5 5
If something goes wrong here and you accidentally break something, do
not panic.  The command "rcsrelease <file pathname>" will revert the file
to the previous version.  If everything works fine, type "rcsin <file
pathname>" to check the file back in so others may access it.
.EP

.SP 5 5
The rcsin command will prompt you to add a short comment explaining
what you did.  Please do so.
.EP

.SP 5 5
For example:
.EP

.SO 80 -5
     rcsin /d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c
     Enter a comment.
     Enter your text.  Use ** on a line by itself to exit.
     1 ] Fixed typo
     2 ] **
     1 lines - Choose from IDLMCESQ or H for help.

     Quitting and saving.

.EO

.SP 5 5
Typing "rcslog <file pathname>" (for example, rcslog
/d/ram/ohulan/market/market_c) will show you a log of all changes done to
the file.

For example:
.EP

The error is now fixed; all that needs doing is to mark the bug
report as done so no one else wastes time trying to fix it.  This is done
by entering the errors menu again, either by typing "errors" while in the
directory or by using "finderrors".

Pressing h for the helpfile will give you the following:

In this case you would use option d, as you have fixed the error.  
This will mark it as fixed and put you back to the error menu.  At this
point, DO NOT QUIT USING Q; that will quit you out of the menu.  The
correct option is x, which will save and quit.  If you do press q, do not
panic.  It will ask you if you really do want to quit without saving.  
Selecting x will automatically send the person who reported the bug mail
telling them it was fixed.

This helpfile explains how to fix bugs using ftp and the mud.  For
your information, it is also possible to use the error handler on the
secure pages of the Disc's webpage to fix bugs.  It works in a similar
fashion as the handler on the mud does, but has a few significant differences.
.EP

.SP 5 5
In the web handler, you can enter a directory, like /d/ram/, and select
whether you would like to search the subdirectories for errors.  In doing 
this, you have the choice of errors to search for.  You can see all of the
errors in the directory, which includes the ones open, fixed, or fixing, or
choose to just view one type, for example the open (not yet fixed) bugreps.
Also, you can choose to view just the bugs, typos or ideas in the directory,
or again, view them all.  There is an index of the bugs in the directory, 
which will let you view all of the bugs in a list, and shows the dates, this
is useful for seeing the newer bugreps, instead of having to search through
them all for the new ones, that have shown up on finderrors.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Another advantage this interface has, is that you can see the numbers in each 
individual directory, so, if you had for example /d/guilds/priests and also
/d/guilds/assassins in your finderrors list, a finderrors count would only
show the total bugs, but by using the web for just priests, this allows you
to see how many are in each directory.  There are also other options to 
search from, such as only show reports with fixer..., only show reports
about..., only show reports containing..., don't show reports containing...
These options allow you to search out bugs specifically for the ones you are
looking for.
.EP

.SP 5 5 
When you view a bug report using the web interface, there is an option
availible for you to edit the file in question.  (This is useful for those
quick fixes during times when you can web surf, but not mud)  Upon editing
the file to a fixed version, it will save the file to /tmp/<creator>/, where 
<creator> is your name.  The file can then be copied to the relevent directory
when you next log on.  The /tmp/<creator> directory will be added 
automatically, there is no need for you to make one yourself.  
.EP

.SP 5 5
A popular option is to use both handlers together, search for bugs using the
web handler, fix them using the mud, and then mark as fixed using the web. 
When a bug is marked as fixed using the web, it is important to click on the
save button, this is the same as quitting with X in the mud interface, and 
will send a mail to the people who reported the bugs.  The don't save option
is the same as q in the mud, and will just quit and leave the bugs.
The choice of interface is entirely down to personal preference, some like 
the web, some only use the mud, but it is always nice to have the option of 
more.

I hope this helps people to understand bug fixing a little better.
