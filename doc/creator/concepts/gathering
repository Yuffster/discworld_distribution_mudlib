Gathering - How to use the gathering handler and its data file

.SH Overview
.SP 5 5

The gather command uses:
.EP

     /obj/handlers/gathering.c and its data file,
     /obj/gatherables/handler.dat

.SP 5 5
The gathering handler draws upon data stored in its data file.  All entries in 
the data file must be correctly completed, or the handler will fail to load and 
all items which would normally be gatherable, will suddenly stop being 
gatherable.

Items can be made gatherable from just about any source.  Most items on the 
handler are currently in /obj/plants but items in /obj/food and any other 
directory can be made gatherable.  There are currently no restrictions upon 
this.
.EP

.SH Adding the item to the data file

.SP 5 5
For example, to make nettles gatherable, imagine that the path is 
/obj/plants/nettle.ob
This would then be added to the end of the handler.dat file like so:
.EP
 
::item "nettle"::
::->season:: ({ "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter" })
::->quant:: (: random(3) + 3 :)
::->ob:: "/obj/plants/nettle.ob" 

.SP 5 5
The data in this file is in the form of a mapping, so adding new entries is 
easy.  Before returning the file to RCS, check that the handler 
(/obj/handlers/gathering.c) loads, and double check that you can still gather 
items.
.EP

.SH Adding the item to a room
.SP 5 5

Items can be gathered from a room by using the gather command within an 
add_item as shown below:
.EP

add_item( "nettle", ({
          "long", "Tall and stong, with the occasional white flower, these "
          "nettles certainly look very stingy indeed.",
          "gather", ({ "item name", "nettle", "scarcity", 30 }) });

.SP 5 5
The simple addition of:
.EP

     "gather", ({ "item name", "<item>", "scarcity", <value> }) 

.SP 5 5
in an add_item allows a valid item (one that is in the data file) to be gathered 
from a room.

The scarcity parameter is the percent chance of finding any quantity of the 
gatherable.  This is an additional constraint on finding the gatherable, in 
addition to any skill requirements and quantity calculations.  A scarcity of 100 
(the default) indicates no scarcity constraint.  A scarcity of 0 means that the 
gatherable will never be found. 
.EP

.SH Summary
.SP 5 5

So, to make an item gatherable:
.EP
	*	Create the item.
        *       Add item to /obj/gatherables/handler.dat
        *       Update data file then update handler (/obj/handlers/gathering.c) 
to ensure that the handler still loads - if not debug it or remove changes until 
the handler loads.
        *       Add item to the room you want to gather it in.
.EP
