The keys are for the doors.  They inherit /std/object so all the normal
functions are supported.  They also have two other functions.

void set_type(string str);
string query_type();

void set_type(string str);
This function lets you set the type that will determine which doors the key will
open.  The matching function on /obj/door is set_key(type).

string query_type();
This function returns the current type of the key.
