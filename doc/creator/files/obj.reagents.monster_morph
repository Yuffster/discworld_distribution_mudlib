Monster Morph

Name
.SP 5 5
monster_morph - transient object for creating monsters
.EP

Description
.SP 5 5
In order to make reactions more flexible, customizable, and just
downright interesting, a class of objects - "transients" - was
created.  Transients exist for a specific period of time, printing
messages to the player(s) and calling functions at regular intervals.
When they expire, they perform some specific action, such as exploding
or changing into another object.  The base transient is
/obj/reagents/reaction.c.
.EP

.SP 5 5
The monster_morph object was written to allow the creation of NPCs
from a reaction, for creating things like familiars and homunculi.  It
allows the setting of the race, guild, etc., and can set the monster's
level relative to the player's skill level.  Since it inherits the
standard reaction transient, it also has access to all of its
functions.

Functions
.EI

.SI 10
void set_relevant_skill( string s )
.EI

.SP 15 5
This sets the skill to be used in determining the monster's level (see
set_result_level() below).
.EP

.SI 10
void set_result_name( string rname )
void set_result_short( string rshort )
void set_result_long( string rlong )
void set_result_race( string rrace )
void set_result_al( string ral )
void set_result_class( string rclass )
void set_result_gender( int rgender )
void set_result_level( int rlevel, float scale )
void set_result_max_hp( int rmax_hp )
void set_result_weight( int rweight )
.EI
.SP 15 5
These functions set the respective attributes of the created monster.
If the supplied value is 0, the attribute is not modified. The
supplied value is used directly, except for set_result_level().  In
this case, the level is the supplied value (rlevel) times the amount
of the transient, times the skill bonus of the player (see
set_relevant_skill() above), times the scale.  Note that the scale is
a floating point value, so it should have a good dynamic range.

.SI 10
void monster_morph()
.EI
.SP 15 5
This is the final function for the transient.  It clones the monster,
sets the attributes as given, and moves the monster to the room of the
container (no matter how deep down the container is).
