Name
.SP 5 5
reaction - Base transient object for the reaction handler
.EP

Description
.SP 5 5
In order to make reactions more flexible, customizable, and just
downright interesting, a class of objects - "transients" - was
created.  Transients exist for a specific period of time, printing
messages to the player(s) and calling functions at regular intervals.
When they expire, they perform some specific action, such as exploding
or changing into another object.  The base transient is
/obj/reagents/reaction.c.  It can be used as the basis for more
complex transients through inheritance, or used as-is in a virtual
object.  Note that most of the attributes correspond to fields in the
reaction handler database; these can be set directly by the reaction
handler at creation.

Functions
.EI

.SI 10
void set_progress_msg( mixed *msg )
.EI
.SI 10
void add_progress_msg( mixed *msg )
.EI
.SI 10
void query_progress_msg( )
.EI
.SP 15 5
These functions manipulate the set of progress messages.  Each
"message" is printed at equal intervals over the duration of the
object.  That is, if there are n messages, the duration is divided
into n intervals. query_progress_msg() simply prints the progress
message array to the screen for debugging.
.EP

.SP 15 5
The term "message" is something of a misnomer.  Each "message" is
actually a printed message and an array of process_string-type strings
(but without the "@@" around them - they're added automatically).
This allows things such as the description of the object to be changed
as the reaction progresses (see "Pseudo-objects" below).
.EP

.SI 10
void set_duration( int time )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This sets the total duration of the object.  Note that the interval
time is calculated here also, so this should be called after
set_progress_msg() (although add_progress_msg() recalculates the
interval, so messages may be added afterwards).
.EP

.SI 10
void set_final( string s )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This sets the function that should be called when the object expires.
The final function either creates a new object in the transient's
place, or causes some interesting effect to occur.  Two functions are
defined: "boom" and "morph" (see below).
.EP

.SI 10
void set_result( string s )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This sets the path of the object that is created when the transient
expires.  If the final function doesn't create a result object, this
need not be called.
.EP

.SI 10
void set_result_alias( string s )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This specifies the medium alias for the result.  If there is no
result, or if the result is not continuous, this need not be called.
.EP

.SI 10
void set_result_amt( int amt )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This specifies the amount of the result to be created.  If the result
is continuous, this is the continuous amount.  Otherwise, it is
divided by AMT_PER_WGT (currently 200) and used as the weight of the
result.  Note a slight inconsistency here: if the reaction handler
creates a non-continuous object directly, it uses the "result_amount"
field as the weight directly.  There was a reason for that, but for
the life of me I can't think what it was.
.EP

.SI 10
void set_hp_base( int hp )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This specifies a base hp value (per amount) for reactions that cause
damage.  See the "boom" final function for an example.
.EP

.SI 10
void start_reaction( )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This is the function that gets the transient going.  It is usually
called by the reaction handler.
.EP

.SI 10
void boom( )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This is a final function.  The purpose is to cause damage (such as
when a potion is mixed improperly and explodes).  The damage done
depends on where the transient is.  If it's being held by a player,
the player gets full damage.  If it's in a container held by a player,
the container is dested, all contents are moved up to the next viable
container, and the player receives 1/2 damage.  If the transient is
sitting in a room, everyone gets 1/2 damage.  If it's in a container
in a room, everyone gets 1/5 damage and the container is dested as
above.  The function will also produce a result object if one has been
specified, placing it in the environment of the (now destroyed)
container.
.EP

.SI 10
void morph( )
.EI
.SP 15 5
This final function can be used for generic object creation.  It
creates the result object and, if the container can handle it, puts it
in place of the transient.  Otherwise, it destroys the container and
its contents.  This function is great for adding a little pizazz to a
reaction, rather than just quietly creating the new object.  It's also
good for adding delays, introducing temporary state changes, etc.

Pseudo-objects
.EI
.SP 10 5
To make customization easier, certain strings can be used in the
function call part of the progress messages to represent various
objects.
.EP
.SO 15 15 -35
	#obj#	represents the transient itself.
	#env#	represents the environment of the transient.
	#env2#	represents the environment of the environment of the transient.
	#result#	represents the result object (obviously, this can only be used in the final progress message).
