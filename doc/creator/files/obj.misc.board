A configurable bulletin board.

To put one in a room:

board = clone_object("/obj/misc/board");
board->set_datafile("board_name");

Note:  Two bulletin boards shouldn't referance the same datafile, as
this will cause the loss of notes if notes are added simulataneously
to both boards.  All boards are saved in /save/board/
