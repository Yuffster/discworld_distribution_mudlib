.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is called when an item is being delivered to a player.  The 
delivery message or the burdened mess is used depending on how the item
is delivered, and then it is removed from the delivery mapping.


Note that this routine uses add_message() to display movement messages to the player, instead of tell_object() or a traditional move message. This is so that the messages can be 'clumped' together properly, otherwise it just doesn't work.
