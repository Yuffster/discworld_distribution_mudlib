.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adds the object into the login handler's static login calls 
list.  It only ever needs to be called _once_, and doesn't need to be 
called every time the object loads. 


Once this is done, the object will automatically be loaded whenever someone logs on. 

This must be called in order for the delivery system to work at all.
