.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This sets a new description for what there are pieces of.
For example, if you want the short of the food before it
is cut up to be 'bar of chocolate', without the piece
substance being set, when it is cut up it will become
'a piece of bar of chocolate'.  If you set this in enables
you to change that unwieldly description to 'a piece of
chocolate'.
