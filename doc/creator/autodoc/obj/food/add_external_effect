.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This adds an external effect to the food.  This will be added to
the player or NPC when the liquid is splashed, applied, or rubbed on them.


The effect is added with a number as the argument. The number is based on the amount which is splashed (in weight units), and usually represents the strength of the effect. If the object is continuous, the weight is calculated from the amount and weight_unit array... 


.EP
.SP 5 5
eff_num = (amount * number * weight_unit[0]) / weight_unit[1] 

...where the number is passed into the add_external_effect() function. If the effect already exists, then the number is added onto the existing number.
