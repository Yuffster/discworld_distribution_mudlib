.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This sets the eat function of the food.  The function is
carried out when the food is consumed.  The eat message,
set with set_eat_mess(), is displayed when this function
is carried out.


The eat mess should be treated exactly the same as a add_succeeded_mess(), as it is processed later as add_succeeded_mess(eat_mess, ({ }));
