.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is for dealing with the object when bits are shaved off.
If it is split up by someone referencing it we are moved into a
special environment so we do not interfer with the old pile.  The
property "medium dest" will be used as the place to go, otherwise
the environment will be used.  This method sticks it into a special
on the fly created container.
