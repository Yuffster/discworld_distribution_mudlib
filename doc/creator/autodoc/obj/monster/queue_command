.SH Description
.SP 5 5

actions where they are queued as for players.  If there are no
commands pending the command is executed immediately.  This function
is 100% compatible with delay_command() and init_command().

.SH Example 1
.SI 5
ob = clone_object(NICE_HAIRY_APE);
ob->queue_command("'I am a hairy ape!");
ob->queue_command("emote apes around the room.",5);
ob->queue_command("get banana",10);
ob->delay_command("emote get apple.",3);
Right away it says "I am a hairy ape",
2 seconds later it apes around the room,
5 seconds after that it gets a banana
and 13 seconds (10+3) after that it gets an apple.
