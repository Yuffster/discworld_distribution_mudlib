.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adds an action to the npc that will happen if a specified
spell is cast.  This is an action which
has a chance of occuring when a spell is being cast.
The name is an identifier
which can be used to remove the action with later.  The action
itself can be a string, then that command will be executed.  If
the action is a function pointer then it will be evaluated with
two arguments, the first being the caster, the second being the
target(s) array and the third being the magic arguments class.


If the action is an array, if it is one element then the function specified will be called on the attacked with the same arguements as above. If the size of the array is two then the function will be called on the specified object with an extra first argument being the npc which the effect is being called from.
