.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method is used to determine when to throw people out of a
room.  This is what detritus uses to throw people out of the
mended drum when it gets a bit rowdy.


The hps is the level of hps at which the npc will start throwing people out with the chance of it occuring (chance is a percentage). 

People will be thrown into a random room, if the property "no throw out"is specified on the room then they will not be thrown into that room.
