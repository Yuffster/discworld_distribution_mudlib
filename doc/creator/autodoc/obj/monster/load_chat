.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method loads up the chat strings for the npc.  This will be
an array containing pairs of elements, the first pair is the
weighting of the chat and the second is the chat to use.


All the weights in the array are added up and then a random number is chosen in the weighting. Then that element is looked up in the array. This way you can control a chat and make it rare. 

If the chat string is an array then this a story, the story will be executed one after another and no other chats will be executed in between. If the first parameter of the story array is a number it will be used as a 1/1000 chance of the next story line being displayed. Special strings can be used which will replace with object names, see expand_mon_string() for further information. 

The chat chance is a chance (in 1000) of the chat occuring. You will need to play with this yourself to see which frequency of chatting you wish for your npcs.
