.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method allows you to control the npc and get it to do
actions where they are queued as for players.   The command
is always delayed by delay even if there are no commands pending
unlike queue_command(). This function
is 100% compatible with queue_command() and init_command().
.EP

.SH Example 1
.SI 5
ob = clone_object(NICE_HAIRY_APE);
ob->delay_command("'I am a hairy ape!",10);
ob->delay_command("emote apes around the room.",2);
ob->queue_command("emote get banana.",3);
ob->queue_command("emote get apple.");
After 10 seconds it says "I am a hariy ape",
2 seconds after that it apes around the room,
immediately following that it gets a banana
and 3 seconds after that it gets an apple.
