.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method executes the string passed in.  It handles all the
stuff which is needed from the chat_string stuff.

If the input is a function pointer then it is evaluated with one
parameter, being the npc.

If the input is a string then the first letter determines what will
be done with it.  All these are passed through expand_string
so that exciting things can be done.
