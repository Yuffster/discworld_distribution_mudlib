.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method allows you to control the npc and get it to do
actions.  This can be used for npc control and inteligence.

Be very careful with this command! This does not go through any
command queue like players have and so NPCs can end up doing
tons of commands in very short order.

If you're trying to make your NPC act like a player use
eue_command() instead
