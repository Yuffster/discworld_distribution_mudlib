The Discworld administration is divided into two sections.  The
directors and the trustees.

.SH Directors
.SP 5 5
The directors are typically domain leaders.  Their job is to manage
their domains overseeing the development and direction of the domain
and to manage the creators within it.

Some directors (effectively non-executive directors) may not be domain
leaders but instead manage other aspects of the games maintenance and
development.
.EP

.SH Trustees
.SP 5 5
The other half of the administrative structure is the trustees.  The
trustees carry the ultimate responsibility for the smooth running of
the mud.  They set policies and rules, oversee the development and
management of the machine, driver and mudlib.

They are also the final authority for the resolution of disputes and
infringement of the rules.

A list of the currently active trustees can be found by fingering the
admin domain.

.SH Meritocracy
.SP 5 5
The creative and administrative structures within Discworld are a
meritocracy where those who work well and show ability get promoted.

Every Director and Trustee (except the few original founders) was a
player at one time and has risen through the ranks over several
years.  A typical Trustee will have been working on Discworld for at
least five years.
