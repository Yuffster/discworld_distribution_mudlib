.SH Description
.SP 5 5
There are various measures of your achievements on Discworld, but the most
important one as far as your guild is concerned is your guild level.  Each
guild has fourteen or so deepest level skills, that is skills that have
no subskills, and, irrespective of guild, each one of these can be advanced
to level 300 for the same minimum cost.  Your guild level, as is reported
on your score for instance, is the average of your levels in each of these
primary skills.  You can find out what the primary skills are by going to
your guild room, that is where you spend experience to gain skills, and
use "cost primaries" - the categories containing the primary skills are
also listed for comprehensibility, so remember that primary skills are
always deepest level skills.
