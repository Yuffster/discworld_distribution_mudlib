Description
.SP 5 5
The Discworld astronomical arrangement is rather complicated and I don't
have much time now, so I'll come back and do this properly later on.  Or
you could go and read the relevant entry in the Companion.

.SP 5 5
But, for starters, the Discworld year consists of 8 seasons, thus:
Spring Prime, Summer Prime, Autumn Prime, and Winter Prime,
Spring Secundus, Summer Secundus, Autumn Secundus, and
Winter Secundus.

The calendar command lists which Discworld days will occur on which
real life days for the coming week.
Note that one DW day equals about 8 hours in "real life."
