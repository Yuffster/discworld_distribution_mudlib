.SP 5 5
Due to the way MudOS works every so often Discworld will need to
reboot.  When this happens the mud will shut down and everyone must
logoff.  The mud will be shut down for just a few minutes and then
will return.

Since Discworld saves players inventories this should have no harmful
side-effects for you, but please, leave when Offler says there's just
a minute to go.
