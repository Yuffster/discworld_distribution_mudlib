Help on ye olde truly horrendous line editor.

I - Insert lines.  This command prompts you for a line number and starts
       inserting text before it in the text.
D - Delete lines.  You enter one line or a range of lines to be deleted
L - List all the lines you have entered.
M - Modify text.  Allows you to modify text over one or a range of lines.
       It asks for a piece of text and replaces every occurence of that
       with the new string in all the lines you specify.
C - Continue editing.  This is basically the same as inserting onto the
       end of the text.
E - Enter ed.  This enters the line editor that some of you love to hate.
       Use with caution.  Has been known to burn.
S - Quit the editor and save all the changes.
Q - Quit the editor losing any changes, abandoning what you did.
H - Gives you this file.

Ranges are specified by
num..num ie 1..2 or 3..4

If you don't like this editor, there is an alternative.  Try typing
'editor magic'.
