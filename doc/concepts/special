              ANNOUNCING A REVOLUTION IN LPMUDDING!!!

Discworld will officaly be opening for player on Saturday May the 9th at
12:00 (midnight) GMT.  Using its own incredibly advanced mudlib, it is
truly the finest invention since the combination yogurt squirter and
turnip twaddler.  It mooshes!  It squooshes!  And that's not all...
  -- skill-based (Buzzword!)
  -- Has an ip of discworld.lspace.org 4242
  -- 3.1.2 running its own 3.0 mudlib in native mode.
  -- theme based on Discworld series of books by Terry Pratchett.
  -- *NOT* based on anything having to do with TMI!
  -- Mudlib written mostly by Pinkfish, Furball and Ember.  Driver hacks
     by the one and only Lynscar.  Originaly based on and old copy of the
     Borerline mudlib (long before the one they had running) written
     by Gordon and Handsoff (err Pariah and Xavier now I think).
  -- Advanced parsing lets you do neat things like light all torches,
     light three torches, get three torches from frog, get all from corpses,
     drop 1/2 of torches and any sort of permutation in between!
  -- Buzzword!
  -- Neat combat system has different kinds of attacks (blunt, edged,
     hand-to-hand).  You'll love it, I guarantee.
  -- The finest weather system ever written for LPmud.  (Even moon phases.)
  -- The infamous Pinkfish soul (207 commands, more arguments than anyone
     ever *should* know.
  -- Built-in aliases allow any number of arguments.  
  -- Nicknames, too.
  -- A finger command that's actually useful.
  -- Less fat.
  -- Terminal setting.  You can set your terminal for ANSI color graphics!
     We support multiple terminal types, so if you have a color terminal
     out there that isnt ANSI just let us know.  Can also set the rows and
     columns of your terminal and have the mud auto-maticly wrap rooms
     descriptions and so on for you.
  --Great taste.
  -- Lots of guilds that are integrated with the mudlib.  Choicies will
     include priests, wizards, fighters, witches, thieves, assassins, and 
     merchants.

Many other insane features that sounded good at the time (but I have forgoten
and there just isnt enough room to mention).  Come and take a look.  You
will not regret it, garanteed, or your money back.

Some other buzz words, bee, fly, V-2, not at all well car.

See you there!
Bings from the gods Bastian the always idle and Eskarina the sick at the moment.

Special wombles from
Zoroaster (the hairy?), Pinkfish the gasping and Furball the well furry.

PS Please note the absense of a very silly header thing.
