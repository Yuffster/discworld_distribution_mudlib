.SH Syntax

invoke <staff>

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Magic staves do a variety of things to an area or to the contents of
that area.  Each staff has one purpose (e.g. the staff of light raises
the light level of a room a little, the staff of exit detections finds
hidden or secret exits from a location, etc.) but it is not always
obvious what this is - there are means to identify artifacts and if you
are sufficiently adept you will come to automatically recognise a
particular artifact with time.

In order to be able to invoke a staff, you must be holding it and your
level in "magic.items.held.staff" must be sufficiently high for that
staff.  Every time a staff is used successfully (or it backfires...) one
charge is taken away.

There are also means to recharge staves, but this is generally a hazardous
pastime unless you are very careful.  There are other objects in staff
form that are not artifacts in the sense above, i.e. they do not use
charges or necessarily have a required level for successful use; an example
of such an object is the wizard's staff (with a knob on the end) which is
largely a spell storage device.
