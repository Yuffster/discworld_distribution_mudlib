advancing

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
On Discworld you advance by increasing individual skills.  Skills are modelled as a tree.  At first you'll only see the top-level of this tree, but as you advance the tree will expand.

There are three ways to advance on Discworld:
.EP

.SO 5 15 55
	Taskmaster	The taskmaster is a system that awards skill increases as you use your skills.  Taskmaster awards are shown in yellow on colour terminals.
	Advancing	You can advance at your guild for a small fee.  Which skills can be advanced, and how much it costs depends on your guild.
	Teaching	You can learn skills from other players using the teach/learn commands.
