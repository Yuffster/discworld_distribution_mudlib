.SH Description
.SP 5 5
On Discworld it is possible to get hypothermia and heatstroke if you
wear the wrong clothing in the wrong place.  Clearly such a system
could be intensly annoying and so the Discworld system is very
"gentle".  The effects are far less than you would find in the real
world. Ultimately, of course, you can die from both these conditions,
however it would take significant time to get yourself hot enough or
cold enough for such an eventuality.

.SH Managing your temperature
.SP 5 5
As you start to get too hot or too cold you will begin to sweat or
shiver. If you are getting really, really hot or cold you may
temporarily lose some stat points.

If you are getting cold, put on more clothing, or eat some food. If
you are getting too hot remove some clothing, or drink some water.

You may also find items, spells or rituals that assist in keeping you
comfortable.

Being wet (through sweating or swimming) will help to cool you down.

The command 'temperature' will tell you how warm the place you are in is,
how much warmth/cooling your clothing is giving you, and how hot or cold
you are.
