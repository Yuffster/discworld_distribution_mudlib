.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to set the editor which is used when you add
messages to the bulletin board or send mail to someone.  In fact
whenever you are using an editor :)  The currently supported types
are menu (which is the default), command, magic and ed.

The menu editor comes up with menus prompting you at most points.  The
command one is based on you typing in the commands from the command
line prefaced with a ~.  ie ~h is for help.  Ed is the editor that
some people love and hate.  Please do not try this editor unless you
have used it before, or are feeling particularly masochistic.  The magic
editor was written by Presto.  He thinks it's pretty keen.
