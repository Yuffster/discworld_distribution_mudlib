WARNING: This code is only in the game for playtesters.  Don't
risk your life on this code!

Combat is, by its very nature, dangerous.  Usually at least
one person will die, and everyone is neary guaranteed to
suffer at least some damage.

Further, killing someone is an inherently evil act: though the
forces of good acknowledge its usefulness, they are forced to
hold combat as a last resort for fear of becoming tainted as
their enemies.

For this reason, the concept of 'mercy' has arisen among the
fighting classes.  If a person is outclassed, they can kneel down and beg
for mercy, in the hopes that their opponent will spare
their life.

When a person accepts your surrender, your life is spared.  The
price is that that person then has the option of taking any and
all of your equipment that they wish.  But after all, you are still
alive...  You can't leave the room or the game until your opponent
has taken what they want.  Then you're free to go about your
business, a bit lighter in property and hit points.

When you accept someone's surrender, you can't fight them any
more.  You get experience points and an alignment boost as if
you had killed them, but the alignment boost is weighted slightly
towards the good side, since you spared their life.  You also
get to take any of their equipment that catches your fancy.  After
5 minutes, or if you leave the room, they are free to go
about their business.
