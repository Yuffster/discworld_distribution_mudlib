Guild points - a measure of your capability

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Guild points are a measure of your capability.  As you perform guild
commands such as stealing, sneaking or slashing you use guild points.
When you have used all your guild points you will need to rest before
you can perform anymore such commands.

The number of guild points that you have is determined by the .points
skills and are divided into different skill categories.  The 'gp'
command will tell you how many guild points you have and how many you
can use on different types of commands.

Guild points regenerate automatically with time.
