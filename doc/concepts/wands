.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Magic wands do a variety of things to a specific target.  Each wand
has one purpose (e.g. the wand of healing heals the target a little, the
wand of striking does some damage to the target, etc.) but it is
not always obvious what this is - there are means to identify
artifacts and if you are sufficiently adept you will come to
automatically recognise a particular artifact with time.  In order
to be able to zap a wand, you must be holding it and your level in
"magic.items.held.wand" must be sufficiently high for that wand - there
are rumours of wands of artifact probing which tell the wielder the
level of an artifact and how many charges it has remaining.  Every
time a wand is used successfully (or it backfires...) one charge is
taken away.  There are also means to recharge wands, but this is
generally a hazardous pastime unless you are very careful.
