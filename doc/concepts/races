.SH Humans Rule
.SP 5 5

For a variety of reasons the only race available to players is human.
One of the major reasons for this is that it would be very very hard
to play all but a very few of the other races due to their
peculiarities.

For example, Elves on Discworld are allergic to iron.  They are not
the cool Elves of some other fantasy environments, but rather vicious
magical creatures that are banished from the normal world of people.
