Alignment is one of the central concepts of religion on Discworld.  Just
as the gods come in various shapes and sizes with different tenets and
doctrines to their faiths, the mortal inhabitants of Discworld, including
players, have a variety of alignments reflecting, in some way, their habits
and attitudes to their surroundings.  Each deity requires that a follower's
or priest's alignment be in a certain range for rituals and other favours
to be granted, so if religion is an important component in your life, you
should learn to be careful with actions that affect your alignment.

Given the polarisation of alignment into "good" and "evil", the foremost
of these actions will be the killing of another creature.  Killing a
good creature will generally make you more evil, while killing an evil
creature will generally make you more good.  It's important to note that
the actual act of taking another life is inherently evil, so even if the
creature is "neutral", you may become more evil by its death.

There are various ways to detect the alignment of another creature or
that of yourself - a crude estimate appears on your score, together
with your deity.
