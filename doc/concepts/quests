.SH Description

Quests are, in essence, puzzles that have been worked into the game.  For
example, a number centre around finding items and returning them to NPCs
- Non-Player Characters, another word for the "monsters" that populate
the game.  Others involve figuring out how to get somewhere, or how
to do a particular thing.  On completion, some quests will give rewards.

Now comes the important part of this help file: even an apparently simple
quest takes a lot of work from the person who created it and apart from
coming up with the idea in the first place, they are difficult to code
and often take weeks of planning and debugging.

It is considered against the rules to ask other players how to solve a
quest, to give out quest solutions, or to use others' quest solutions. 
There are a number of reasons
why.  Put yourself in the creator's position - you've just spent many
weeks working on a complex piece of code; one person figures it out
and tells everyone else; wouldn't you be a little upset?  Then there's
a thrill of solving a tricky puzzle: many players get a lot of
satisfaction out of this and if you discuss how to solve a quest on a
public channel or by shouting it, you're probably ruining the game for
many other people.

If you are really stuck then you could, politely, ask someone using
"tell" for a hint - do NOT ask creators for help or hints concerning
quests, they are quite within their rights to ignore you or worse if
you're asking for solutions.
