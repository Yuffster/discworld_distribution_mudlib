.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Discworld uses a hierarchical skill system.  A player has skills numbering
into the hundreds in which they can improve and train.

The skills are broken up into groups.  All skills fall into fighting,
magic, faith, crafts, covert and other.  The skills in magic are then
divided up into spells, items, points and special.  This scheme proceeds
downwards until a skill is finally reached.  Your skill in fighting is
the average of all the skills below fighting.  You can only advance skills
that you have depth*5 skill levels in.  What is meant by this is that
you can only advance the top level fighting until you reach level 5 at
which point, you can advance fighting.combat or fighting.points.  This
means you can either get better at fighting or get more guild points.
Similarly when you get to level 10 in fighting, you can start to
advance either fighting.combat.melee or fighting.combat.dodging.  It
is entirely up to you what you want to advance in.

Other members in your guild should be able to tell you what sort of
things you should advance in to get certain abilities.
