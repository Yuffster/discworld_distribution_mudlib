	*	Keep information general - if a player asks how to use a command, tell them that 'syntax <command>' will tell them the ways in which a command can be used or point them towards the help file.  If they ask how to join a guild, tell them that they should find the right place within the guild buildings and 'join'.

	*	If they ask for help in joining the assassins guild they should be told that the assassins guild is a difficult guild to play, so we don't help newbies to join it.  It's the first test that an assassin needs to face.

	*	If the information can be found in a help file or syntax, ask them to read that rather than (or as well as) telling them the answer.  The more used to finding information for themselves newbies are, the more likely they are to look for something themselves first.
 
	*	If someone says they are lost, direct them to 'help am-map' or the atlas link from our homepage.  Also suggest exploring and making their own maps.

	*	Guild specific questions should either be given a general answer, directed to the appropriate channel of the talker or directed towards other members of that guild.

	*	Chat on the newbie channel should be discouraged and players should be asked to get a talker, and have their newbie command removed in extreme circumstances (alert a Liaison).  Be sure to explain what a talker is, suggest they read their voucher, and don't come across as if there are no acceptable uses for the newbie channel. ;)

	*	It is sometimes better to switch to helping a newbie in tells if they are having a specific problem that cannot be answered in one or two sentences.
