.SH Description
.SP 5 5
During your travels on Discworld, there will be occasions when it is
necessary to fight.  You may be up against an aggressive monster which
is after the taste of your blood, or a mugger who is after the contents
of your purse; you may be fighting a duel with knives or taking part in
a joust.  Your ability to fight is determined by a set of skills and the
way in which you fight is determined by your tactics.

.SH Combat
.SP 5 5
While in combat, every few seconds each combatant will have the
opportunity to attack. Whether they take that opportunity or not
depends on how many other actions they have performed recently and
their tactics.

The attacks available depend on the weapon or weapons that the attacker is
wielding and the successful use of each attack depends on the
attacker's bonus in the relevant skill for that weapon (you won't do
more damage with a "more powerful" weapon unless you have the skills
to match) compared against the defenders skill plus (or minus) a modifier
that is calculated based on a number of factors.

If the target is hit, some of the damage may be absorbed by the target's
armour and the rest of it will damaging the opponent.

.SH Notes
.SP 5 5
You will continue to fight against all of your attackers even if you leave
the room and come back.  Both combatants must use the 'stop' command to
end hostilities.
