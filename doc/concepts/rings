Syntax

twist <ring>

Description
.SP 5 5
Magic rings do a variety of things to the wearer.  Each ring
has one use (e.g. the ring of cleansing cures the wearer of some
poisons, the ring of knurdness will cause the wearer to enter that
state on the other side of intoxication, etc.) but it is
not always obvious what this is - there are means to identify
artifacts and if you are sufficiently adept you will come to
automatically recognise a particular artifact with time.  In order
to be able to twist a ring, you must be wearing it and your level in
"magic.items.worn.ring" must be sufficiently high for that ring.  Every
time a ring is used successfully (or it backfires...) one charge is
taken away.  There are also means to recharge rings, but this is
generally a hazardous pastime unless you are very careful.  There
are some rings that will have some effect on the wearer merely by
being worn; these are not artifacts in the sense above, i.e. they do
not use charges or necessarily have a required level for successful
use.
