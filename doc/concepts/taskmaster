.SH Description
.SP 5 5
There are a variety of ways to gain expertise in skills.  You could spend
time and effort in learning from another person.  You could undertake a
quest and be given an experience reward for completing it successfully
which you can then spend at your guild in exchange for skill levels.  There
are other means too, of course, but the most general and wide-spread method
is via the taskmaster.

The taskmaster system is just a simple, generic procedure for improving a
skill by practising it, that is, by attempting a task that requires some
level of ability in the skill.  Each task requires a certain amount of
skill at which you begin to start succeeding if you attempt it; there is
another, higher threshold, beyond which you will always succeed because
you have mastered that particular task.  Between these two thresholds, you
could attempt the task but fail, or you could attempt the task and succeed,
or you could attempt the task, learn something in the attempt and gain a
level and succeed.
