no score

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The "no score" property prevents a player from showing up on top ten tables, and from applying to certain positions, such as Guild Master.

Players may request this property, but must think carefully first.  It will not be removed.  Ever.  Creator alts are required to have this property.

Just to reiterate, it will not be removed if you request it.
