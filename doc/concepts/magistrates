.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Magistrates have some special powers to rule on cases within their territory.
They can make any decision they wish on a case and the case will
be archived for later access.

Magistrates can also make new laws for the territory.  They can amend
current laws and vote on rule changes.  Only magistrates can start the
process of adding or amending a law.  Citizens have the chance to ratify
all laws before they become a real law.

The jurisdiction of magistrates is only in their own territory.  They 
cannot change rules in other areas or rule on cases brought before magistrates
in other territories.
