.SH Description:
.SP 5 5
The crafts subskills affect your ability to build, create or repair
certain things in the game.  For instance, crafts.smithing.black.weapons
affects your ability to "fix" weapons, or forge new ones.  There are a
few quests that depend on a certain level of competancy in some of them and one of the wizard orders ( the Brothers of the Silver Star ) has certain craft skills as primaries.
To see your current crafting skills, type "skills crafts'.
