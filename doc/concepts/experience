.SP 5 5
Experience points are the currency of advancement.  They are 'spent' in return for skill levels, either from your Guild, or a teacher (either another player, an NPC or yourself).  They are gained by using Guild Commands, killing monsters and burying the corpses.  Additionally, experience points (xp) are gained
by simply being on-line (heartbeat xp) and exploring new areas (exploration xp).
