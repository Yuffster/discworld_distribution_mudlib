The mysterious Underworld Domain gathers all the cross-dimensional stuff on Discworld such as the T-Shop, Death's Domain, Dungeon Dimensions, Hell, Teleport Corridors and L-Space.

The Underworld Domain is not your average, vanilla domain.  It has few geographical constraints, but rather concerns itself with things that step out of the ordinary.
Death is its star, and magic its sunlight.  Particular projects include the expansion of the black areas of the Disc, rattling the cages of the Dungeon Dimensions and special events.
Still; it's the coolest place around and membership is exclusive.

L-space will be fun, too...

Currently, we are looking for experienced coders, either existing Creators, or otherwise. Contact the Director for more information.
