Advice on choosing a password:

 * Please choose a password that you will remember but that will be hard
   for others to guess -- your SO's name is NOT a good choice. :-)

 * Do not share your password with anyone else.

 * Anything that happens to your character is your responsibility.

Forgotten Passwords:

 address in your finger information.  If you do not set an email address
 we cannot reset your password.
