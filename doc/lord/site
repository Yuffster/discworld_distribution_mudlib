site - Stop certain IP addresses from logging on to the Disc

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
site <ip> <level> <reason>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Site allows you to siteban a particular IP or range of IPs.  There are three 
levels of restrictions.  Level 1 means normal access (any previous bans are 
lifted), level 2 means no new players can be created from the site, and 
level 3 means that no-one can log in from the site.

Level 2 is particularly useful in cases where someone is making an nuisiance 
of themselves by logging in abusive newbies and spamming people / channels.  

Sitebans are logged to /log/ACCESS... the reason you give when banning an 
IP will be saved here also.

The IP address is given in numerical form, such as '127.0.0.1'.
