The domainlock command acts as an interface to the Patrician's palace in AM, 
and allows you to set whether your domain is open or closed to applications.
'domainlock <domain> off' will switch off the lock for a particular domain,
allowing players to apply in the palace.  'domainlock <domain> on' will 
lock the domain, meaning no players can apply.  You will be prompted for a 
reason if you do this.

accepting applications.
