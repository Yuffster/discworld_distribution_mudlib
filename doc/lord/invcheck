.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to forbid objects of a particular filename from 
appearing in player inventories.  Creators, playtesters, guests and 
interactives with the 'test character' property set will not be frisked
by the dwarves.  If a banned object appears in the inventory of any
other players, it will be confiscated by the dwarves, have the no recycling
property added to it, and dested.  This command can be used to deal with
playtester items that have leaked into the game.

'Invcheck ban <filename>' is used to add <filename> to the list of banned 
objects.  'Invcheck unban <filename>' removes an entry from the forbidden
list.  'Invcheck list' will list all forbidden objects.
