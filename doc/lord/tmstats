.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Tmstats gives some information on the frequency of taskmaster awards in 
various skill groups.

The information is given in bands... for example, level 0 to level 49 
is one band.  For each band, information is given on how many taskmaster 
tries have been made (as in, any skill check for that level band that goes 
through the taskmaster), how many TM awards were given from those tries, 
and what the ratio for awards is.
