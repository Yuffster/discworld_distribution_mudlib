.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Allows you to reset a player's password.  You must be a highlord to
use this command. 

The policy is that only players with an email address set in their 
finger can have their password reset, and a changed password is 
emailed to that email address.  If the character in question does not
have an email address set in their finger info, but one of their 
registered alts does, then that can be taken as an official email 
address and a password sent to that address.
