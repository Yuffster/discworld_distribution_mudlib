.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The authorise command can be used to allow players to login from banned
IP addresses.  When used in its simplest form 'authorise <player>', it 
will add the 'authorised player' property to the appropriate player.  If
the player does not exist, you will be asked if you wish to create them...
 this is a useful way of allowing a player to login from an IP banned for
new characters.

Using the 'enable' syntax allows you to add an IP address that a player 
is permitted to log on from.  Using the 'disable' syntax allows you to 
remove a previous IP from the list of authorised IP addresses.
