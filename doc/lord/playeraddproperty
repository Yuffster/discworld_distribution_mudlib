playeraddproperty - Add or change a property on a player
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
playeraddproperty <player> "property" <value>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The playeraddproperty command allows you to change or add a property on
a player even if they are not currently logged on.  The command opens 
up their playerfile, rips it to shreds, sticks bits into other bits and 
twists the bits that were there in the first place into new and different 
places, then stitches it back up.  At the end of the procedure, the 
player has the property you added.  Note the quotation marks around the
property itself... these are needed for the purposes of parsing the 
command string.
