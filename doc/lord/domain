.SH Syntax

domain info <domain> [by] {n|name|p|project|l|login}

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The domain command allows you to query and set various pieces of information
about your domain, and query various pieces of information about other 
domains.

'domain project' allows you to set the project of a creator in your domain.  
Note that if you set the project as $project$ then your master object will 
query the project management handler for the list of this creator's projects.

'domain info' by itself will go through the members of each domain and check
to see if they are creators and if they have a directory.  NOTE:  This is very
CPU intensive!  Don't do this in anger.

You can use the specialised 'domain info <domain>' commands to see the list 
of domain members sorted by name, project or last login.  This is useful to 
see which members of your domain have been gone for a long time.  The last online
times are colour coded so you can tell at a glance which creators are worthy of
a red last login time.

'domain add' allows you to add a creator to your domain.  Please note, this will
not employ them.

'domain delete' removes a creator from your domain.  Please note, this will not
dismiss them.

'domain list' will list the members and projects of a particular domain.
