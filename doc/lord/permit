.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The permit command acts as an interface to the file permission system.  You can 
use this command to query the permissions of creators and to permit/revoke 
access if you have the appropriate access yourself to do so.

'permit summary <creator>' will allow you to query the access rights of a particular
creator.  'permit summary' by itself will return all access rights.  This is likely
to be an exceptionally large list.

'permit tidy' will make an attempt to tidy up access permissions for all creators.  
This means that creators with write to /d/ and /d/forn will have their write access 
to /d/forn removed since the access to /d/ supercedes that access.

'permit help' will give some more information on what can be done with the command.

The base command 'permit <permission> <euid> <path>' is used to grant or revoke
a particular permission to a particular creator.  Valid permissions are:

.SH Read
.SP 5 5
Read permission only.  The creator can only read the file.  Unless FTP 
restrictions have been lifted, they also cannot download the file.
.EP

.SH Write
.SP 5 5
Write permission only.  Note, write access does not imply read access.  When 
granted to a directory, creators can write to all files in that directory and
create others.  When granted to a particular file, the creator can only change
and delete that file.
.EP

.SH Grant
.SP 5 5
Grant permission.  Allows the creator to grant read or write access themselves.
Note again that this does not imply read or write access.
.EP
