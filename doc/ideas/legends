That sounds like a good thing. Most players seem to see creatorship
as their ultimate goal (it's a matter of debate as to whether that's
a good thing or not).

That would be level 300 (say) on here, then.

Is that _all_ the quests or just a proportion of them (like the 33%
to apply to be a creator)? I suppose that's something to decide. Having
said that, nearly all high-level players will have done all the quests
to get where they are, so it's probably not that relevant. Or are there
quests specifically aimed at getting legend status?

As I understand it, the reason we have any high-level players at all is
because they don't want to be creators here. Of course, a system like
this to persuade people to stick with it long enough to get to high-level
would changed that.

Even just doubling every level would give more than enough spaces to
accommodate the high-level players. And if there are more players than
spaces, it'll just have to be even more cut-throat :)

Competitive advancement, then, like the University and Assassins' Guild.

A dynamical system is nice, but should the rate of decrease be the same
for being logged on and not being logged on? Maybe a slower rate, but
still non-zero, if the player is not on. And how will information about
the Legend points be available to the player? A verbal description
(along the lines of your fame being represented by how nice a plaque
you have at the Fighters' Guild) is preferable over numbers in my book.

Well, that would provide an alternative sink for xp to endlessly raising
skills to unfeasibly large levels. Cash for points sounds a bit too easy,
though.

These extra facilities need to be carefully balanced, but they would
provide the incentive for players to actually get there. And with a Legend
level restriction on use of the spells/commands/weapons/etc. there'd be
an incentive to stay there. Plenty of opportunity for hybris here :)

And fostering inter-guild co-operation, of course, which is good.

Well, group adventuring is good and this provides one way of formalising
it (more numbers *ugh*). If the logistics can be worked out, and it's
flexible enough, then it's just a matter of seeing if the players would
actually use the system. Titania?

Dibbler doing anything besides selling sausages and getting slaughtered

Deutha, providing some, but there should be more.
