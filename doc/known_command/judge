.SH Description
.SP 5 5
By judging a weapon, you can get an idea of how much damage
it is capable of dealing and you can compare one weapon
against another to see which is the better.  You can only judge
the mundane damage capabilities of weapons and how well you
are able to judge depends on your bonus in other.evaluating.weapons.  It
costs 25 other points to judge a weapon and twice
that to compare one weapon with another.
