.SH Description
.SP 5 5
As a newcomer to Discworld, there will doubtless be times when
you will need a little advice or encouragement.  Using this
command, you can ask a question of all the players and creators
currently listening.

The newbie channel is not a general chat channel; it is for when
you need assistance.  If you over use it, people won't listen
and you won't get the help you need.  So do not use it to generally
chat and do not use it to ask for quest solutions.

You can use the hnewbie part of the newbie command to see what has been
previously said on the newbie channel.  This will display the last twenty
chats on the newbie channel, and allows you to check whether or not your
question was just asked on the channel.

To save using newbie channel, much useful information can be seen by
reading help essentials, and help FAQ.

Please note that you will lose the use of this command when you are
18 hours old in the game.
