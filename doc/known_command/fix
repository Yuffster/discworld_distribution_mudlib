.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to fix up weapons and armour which have
been damaged through their use in combat.  If your bonus in
crafts.smithing.black.weapons for weapons and
crafts.smithing.black.armour for armour
is high enough for the job, you may be able to repair the item
completely; otherwise you will only be able to repair it a
little that time.  It does not cost guild points to fix an item,
but you will be charged an amount of money for materials that
you use.  This cost depends on how much you are able to fix the
item, how much it is worth and where you do the fixing - you
must be in a smithy.  The cost of repairs will also be more for
an item with a lower all-time minimum condition.
