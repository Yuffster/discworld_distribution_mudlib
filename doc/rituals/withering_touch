.SH Description
.SP 5 5
When performed on a corpse, this ritual offers the flesh to the
priest's god, in exchange for being able to absorb the life force
contained within to heal the priest's wounds.  The efficiency of
this ritual depends on the priest's skill with miscellaneous
rituals, and it will require a holy symbol to perform as well as
a suitable sacrifice.
