Divine Sentinel stores the power of a single ritual within an object, allowing
a priest to protect it from theft. You need a holy symbol, some incense, a 
prayer book and a copy of "Impressions of the faithful" to perform this ritual.
After you have performed this ritual on an item, you will need to "impress" 
another ritual into it.
