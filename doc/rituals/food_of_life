.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This ritual uses allows you to enchant pieces of meat to hold
healing power, which will be released on consumption of the
aforementioned flesh.  The effects are dependant on your skills
in the healing and miscellaneous tree, as well as the weight
and race of the corpse parts in question.

You will need some parsley to perform this ritual correctly - gods
are fussy eaters, and of course the flesh you wish to use.
