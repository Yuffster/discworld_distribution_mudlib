Endless Halls -- Ties an enemy up in the endless halls of Sandelfon.
.EP

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Endless Halls calls upon Sandelfon to create a maze of sufficient complexity
to hold a target while you can make a quick escape. To perform this ritual
you need a prayer book with the prayer "The Nature of Corridors by
'Octarina the Just'" in it. Transporting someone to the maze of Sandelfon is
an offensive act.
