Paralysis -- freezes someone's muscles.

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This ritual causes the victim's muscles to freeze into tense knots, so that they cannot move at all.  Fortunately for them, the desire for self-preservation will kick in if they are threatened.  Less fortunate is the fact that someone as immobile as a statue is quite easy to strike with a weapon.
