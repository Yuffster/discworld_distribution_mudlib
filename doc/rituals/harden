.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is a useful miscellaneous ritual which also draws upon the
priest's skills in crafting materials.  When performed upon an item
of clothing, it will lend holy power to the item, strengthening
it, reducing its chance of being damaged and increasing its
protective value.  It requires a holy symbol, incense and a holy
amulet to perform.
