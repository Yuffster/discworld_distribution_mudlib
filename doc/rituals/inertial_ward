.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Inertial Ward creates a bond between your God, an item, and it's location to the extent where your God
will watch the item to ensure it is not being moved. In the event that it does move, the God in question
will destroy the item in an explosive manner before reforming it and moving it back to it's original location.
Inertial Ward requires a prayer book, and a holy symbol.
