.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This ritual is primarily used by Pishites, calling upon Her to summon
a blessed shower of rain.  If performed correctly, the rain will
send anyone in the room who is attacking the priest to sleep.  Since
the intent of this ritual is to be able to escape a threat without
harming them, Pishe will also watch over the victims until they wake
to ensure they come to no harm.  You will need holy incense to
perform this ritual.
