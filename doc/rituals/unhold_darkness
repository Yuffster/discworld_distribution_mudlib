.SP 5 5
Unholy Darkness - A night darker than Sek's heart 
.EP

.SH Description
This is a miscellaneous ritual, which summons spirits to remove the light
from an area.  This darkness is absolute, and as such, incurs penalties
beyond those given by a moonless night.  In fact, this darkness is pure
enough, being the opposite of light, rather than its absence, that no
methods of vision work within its bounds.
It requires a holy symbol and a holy amulet to perform, and may be dispelled
before it fades on its own, but only by the priest.
