.SH Description
.SP 5 5
'options earmuff' by itself displays information saying whether your earmuffs
are currently on or off.  'options earmuff events' shows which things you
currently have earmuffed.

'options earmuff state=on' turns on the blocking.  All of the
events you have set to be blocked will be blocked from this time on,
you won't see them.  The off parameter turns off the blocking.  The
status of the blocking is independant of the actual events being blocked.

'options earmuff state=allowfriends' turns on the blocking, but it
allows all of your friends to still communicate with you.  It blocks
everyone else.

The last thing you can do with the command is turn on and off the blocking
of the various events.  If you don't specify on or off after the type the
value is toggled.  If you put an on or off there it is set to that value.
