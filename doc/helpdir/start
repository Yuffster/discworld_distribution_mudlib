.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Sometimes, unfortunately, when you log in, you cannot be placed where you
were when you logged out last time.  In these instances, you are moved to
your "starting location", which is initially the Mended Drum and then
becomes your guild room when you join a guild.  As you explore Discworld
further and locate other branches of your guild, these will be added to
your list of possible starting positions from which you can choose, at
any time, your current starting position.  In this way, if you are involved
in a lengthy expedition across Klatch, you may set your current starting
position to be your guild room in Ephebe as being the closest to your
current area of exploration.
