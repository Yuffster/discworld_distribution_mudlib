.SP 5 5
The describe command is used to put a line about you in your long description
that players get when they look at you.  It is also used in your reference.

Describe with no parameters will print your current description.
Describe clear will clear your description.

Describe edit will drop you into the editor you have chosen and allows you
to edit your description.

You can describe zones of your body which will allow the descriptions to
be optionaly displayed if those zones are covered with clothes or not.  The
zone descriptions are added together as if they are sentences, so if you do
not use a complete (or multiple) sentence for your zone descriptions they
will not look right.
