.SH Caveats
.SP 5 5
`consider' takes into account such things as weapon, armour, offensive and
defensive skill and hit points so your results may vary depending on the
health and equipment of the monsters at the time.

`consider' does not take into account any special tactics, commands, rituals 
or spells which may be employed by you or your opponents.

At high levels (for both players and NPCs) consider becomes more and
more inaccurate.

If you consider multiple targets it will attempt to calculate your chances
against all the monsters at once - but it's only a rough guide.
