.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Ignore allows you to block all tells from a player.  Unignore will
remove a player from your ignore list and ignore on its own will tell
you who you are currently ignoring. 'unignore all' will stop you
ignoring anyone.

Ignore is intended to provide temporary relief from harassment and
other inappropriate behaviour until such time as a liaison can deal
more appropriately with the problem.  It is not intended to make
anyone disappear from the game.  As such ignore's are not permanent
and will timeout.
