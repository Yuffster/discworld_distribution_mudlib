.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This allows you to track down your friends and keep track of them.  It
controls all the people you have in your friends list and lets you add
a small tag beside each friend.

The command by itself will list all of your currently setup friends.  The
command with only one argument will list information about that one
friend.

The <tag> part will add a message you will see when the person logs in/out
of Discworld, or when you list your friends

If you use the 'friends clear' command it will clear all of the friends in
your friend list.

If you use the 'who', 'qwho' or related commands you can use 'friends' as
an argument to get the list of your currently online friends.
