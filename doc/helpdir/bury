.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command will tidy the place up by burying stuff that you list.  It restores
a few guild points to you for being such a good citizen, as well as awarding
a substantial proportion of experience points for burying corpses.

If you don't specify something to bury, all the corpses littering the floor
around you (or the first one, depending on your chosen parser options) will be
buried.

The command 'recover' will allow you to recover stuff that was recently
buried.
