.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command informs the creators of ideas you have about commands, spells,
objects (room items, normal items, NPCs, etc.), rituals, help files, rooms,
or in general.  The first argument is used to specify what type of
idea the report object the idea is about, while the second is the name
of the command, spell, etc.  The second argument is not used for rooms as
"here" is implicit, it's also not used for general ideas.

The idea report is recorded in a database specific to whatever you are using
the command for, so try to be specific in your use.

If you report an idea for a new spell or a spell you haven't remembered at the
moment, you can use the name of one you have, as all spells are maintained by
the same creator, so the report will still go to the right person.  The same
is true for rituals.

To report ideas in rooms just stand in them and use the command.

To report ideas about objects be VERY SPECIFIC.  For example, if you've got
three swords, don't use 'idea object sword' because the idea report will go to
the first sword even if it's not the one you have an idea about.

Especially for creators: the object can be specified by filename.

To report ideas about commands, spells and rituals, just put the name of
the command or spell as you know it as the second argument.

To report ideas for a help file, use 'idea help <name>', PLEASE only use this
for reporting ideas about helpfiles.

For new spells you use the command 'idea spell new' and for new rituals
you use the command 'idea ritual new'.
