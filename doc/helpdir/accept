.SH Description
.SP 5 5
During combat, other players and NPCs may occasionally offer a
surrender to you.  This generally occurs because you're 
soundly whupping their butt, but there are other possible causes.

If you are feeling in a merciful mood today, you can accept their
surrender with this command.  You will be told precisely what you need
to type to accept their surrender when the surrender is offered.

This command is also used to accept an offer of a sale from someone else.
