.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The mailer enables players to send and receive mail to and from other
players.  The Ankh Morpork Post Office is located two south, five east,
one northeast, one east, one southeast and four south from the bar area
of the Mended Drum.  In this room you may "mail <person>" to send mail to
a person, or simply type "mail" to look at mail sent to you.

.SH Sending mail
.SP 5 5
Once you have typed "mail <person>", you are prompted for a subject. 
Note that you can mail more than one person in one go, by simply mentioning
more names, separated by spaces or commas.

The subject is a one line summary of what the mail is about.  If you leave it
blank, you leave the sending mail process.  After this you are asked for 
Cc's, or Carbon-Copy recipients.  Enter anyone else who should receive the
mail, one per line.  Enter a blank line to stop.  Then you can enter the body
of the mail itself.  This will be edited with your default editor, the
default editor is a menu editor.  Please see "help edit_help" for its use.
If you have an alias for ".signature", then, in a similar format to that
of .plan (see finger), it will be appended to your mail.

.SH Reading mail
.SP 5 5
Typing "mail" takes you to the main screen of the Discworld mailer.
This consists of as many message headers as will fit your screen, and
a brief description of all the options you have.  To read the next
unread mail message, you can just press <enter>.  The last read
message has a '>' in front of it and is highlighted.  This is the
default message that will be used with a number of options if you
don't supply a number.  To read a specific mail message, you may enter
its number.  You get a number of other options at this point, all of
which can also be viewed by typing '?' in the main menu:
.EP

.SI 5
h [range] ............ Main menu (showing subjects and stuff).  If you
			    give a range, the subjects in the range will be
			    displayed.  Otherwise as many as will fit your
			    screen.  "h all" will show all subjects, even
			    if that means you get 6 screens at once :-).
$ .................... Reloads the current folder, so anything you
			    changed will not be saved (like marking as
			    read/deleting).
m <name> ............. Mails to the given person(s).
r [num] .............. Replies to the message number or the last read
			    message if none given.
R [num] .............. As above but sends to the Cc's as well.
d [range] ............ Deletes a range of messages.
u [range] ............ Undeletes a range of messages.
f [num] <name> ....... Forwards the message to the person(s) given.
F [num] .............. Forwards the message to your email address, if set.
			    Please make sure that this is a valid address!
> [range] <folder>.... Copies given message(s) to a folder.  It will
			    be created if it doesn't exist yet.
s [range] <filename> . Creators only: saves given message(s) to given
			    file.  If no full pathname is given it will be
			    saved in the current directory(!).  The
			    resulting file is in email format, so it can
			    be read by an email program.
i .................... Index of your mail folders.  You always have at
			    least an inbox.
c <name> ............. Change to given folder (if it exists).
l .................... List the currently available mailing lists.
l <list> ............. List the members of the mailing list <list>.
L .................... Toggles showing of full/abbreviated header for
                       messages.  The default is abbreviated.
q .................... Quit, the mailer will ask if you want to
			    delete/move marked/read messages. It asks if
			    you want to move the read messages from your
			    inbox to the received folder.
? .................... Display this help file.
<num> ................ Display given message.
.EI

.SP 5 5
Return on a blank line will display the next unread message.

A range is defined as a list of comma separated numbers or spans.
So "1-2" is defined as well as "1,2,3" and "all" is a special case
that means all messages, so "d all" is a valid command.

It does intelligent matching, so if there are 4 messages and you typed 
"d 1-30" it will delete the 4 messages and will not complain.

You can execute all commands by just typing the letter, the mailer will then
explain what you have to type.
.EP

.SH Nicknames
.SP 5 5
The mailer can use nicknames, and as just more than nickname-to-name
replacement.  The mailer will recognise nicknames when you "mail <person>",
"mail <person1> <person2>", enter Cc's, forward mail, or "m <person>" from
the main menu.

With the "mail <person1> <person2>" format, it will expand the entire line as
a nickname first.  You could use this for your own form of mailing lists.
Nicknames within these lists are also expanded.
