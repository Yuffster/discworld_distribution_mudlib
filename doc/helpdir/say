.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Say sends the message to all of the people in the room.  If you were in a
room and Furball had said 'hello' then you would see:

Furball says: hello

This is the main method of communicating on the mud.

The # and @ can be used to use a specific language and an adverb to the
message.  You can use partial matching for a language, so for example
#dj will make you speak in djelian.  You may also put the language name
in quotes after the # to speak in languages which have spaces in them.

There is an option to do with accents that allows you to see the text
mangled, or a short string saying what the accent is.  Use the option
output accent to set the behaviour.
