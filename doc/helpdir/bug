.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command informs the creators of bugs in commands, spells, objects (room
items, normal items, NPCs, etc.), rituals, help files, rooms, help
files.  The first argument is used to specify what type of bug report
it is, while the second is the name of the command, spell, etc.  The
second argument is not used for rooms as "here" is implicit.

This command is also used to read any replies the creators make to specfic
bug reports you made.  You can read your bug replies by going 'bug replies',
to see bugs that are not new use 'bug replies all'.

.SH Notes
.SP 5 5
If a catastrophic event has occurred, as well as bug reporting it, please contact a liaison (or other creator) as soon as possible, or mail one.

Please use a separate report for each bug, so that each bug can be allocated and fixed in turn.

.SH Details
.SP 5 5
The error message is recorded in a database specific to whatever you are using
the command for, so try to be specific in your use.

If you have to report a bug in a spell you haven't remembered at the
moment, you can use the name of one you have, as all spells are bugfixed by
the same creator, so the report will still go to the right person.  The same
is true for rituals.

To report errors in rooms just stand in them and use the command.

To report errors in objects be VERY SPECIFIC.  For example, if you've got three
swords, don't use 'bug object sword' because the error report will go to the
first sword even if it's not the one with the error.  Instead, make sure
which one is giving you the error and use something like 'bug object sword 2',
or you can put in its full name, i.e. 'bug object sword of doom'.

Specially for creators: the object can not currently be specified by filename.

To report errors in commands, spells and rituals, just put the name of
the command or spell as you know it as the second argument.

To report errors in a help file, use 'bug help <name>', PLEASE only use this
for reporting bugs in helpfiles.
