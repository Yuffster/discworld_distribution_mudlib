.SH Description
.SP 5 5
You can set the percentage of your hit points at which you run away.  If
you have set the number to zero (default) you are in brave mode and won't
run away even if you are almost dead (in fact even if you are dead).

.SH Caveat
.SP 5 5
While wimpy is very effective and will generally get you out of harms way
this is not guaranteed.  Even with wimpy you can still die!
