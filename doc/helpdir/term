term - Set your terminal type

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
options terminal type=[<terminal-type>]
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Term sets your terminal type.  If you experiment with terminal types it is your
own fault if your terminal hangs... which it may do if it is not compatible.
Currently supported are 'dumb', 'ansi', 'freedom', 'hpterm', 'aixterm',
'xterm', 'vt100', 'vt220', 'ibm3151', 'vt100-nc' and 'vt220-nc'.
At the moment 'ansi', 'xterm', 'vt100' and 'vt220' support different colours.
'vt100-nc' and 'vt220-nc' are 'no colour' versions of these popular terminals.
They attempt to emulate colour using combinations of bold, reverse video and
underline attributes.

You can also set your terminal type to 'network', which will cause Discworld
to use telnet negotiation to figure out your terminal type.  This is the
default setting.
