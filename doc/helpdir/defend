.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Makes you defend the person.  Defending someone means that you will
attempt to parry on their behalf and so defend them.  This is useful
for protecting spell casters whose spells are interrupted by combat.
Note that this command is only useful if your combat response is set
to parry.

If you use this command without any arguments it shows who is defending
you and who you are defending in the room.
