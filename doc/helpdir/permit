.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command is available to non-playerkillers to enable them to permit
other players to take things from their corpse.

The player who is permitting will need to have a corpse, but they do not
have to be a ghost to use the command.  Also, both the permittee and the
permitter do not have to be in the same room as the corpse for the
command to work.
