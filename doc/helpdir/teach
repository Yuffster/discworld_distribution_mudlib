.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to teach a command or skill to another
player.  In the case of commands the person doing the
teaching needs to be experienced enough in the skill to teach it, and the
person being taught also needs to be experienced enough to learn the skill.

In the case of skills the person doing the teaching needs to be of
a higher bonus than the person being taught.  The cost in
experience to the teachee is based on the relative bonus of the
person teaching and the person being taught.

If the person you are trying to learn from has 'auto teach' turned on then
you can learn skills from them directly without them having to 'teach' you.  
Use the 'options' command to toggle 'auto teach' on 
and off.
