.SP 5 5
WARNING: This code is only in the game for playtesters.  Don't risk your life on this code!

During combat, you will sometimes find yourself outmatched.
Rather than losing your life over the mistake, you can opt
to surrender to your opponent.

This command controls the level at which you will try to surrender.
The number represents a percentage of your maximum hit points:
if you ever drop below that level, you will offer a surrender
to your opponent.

Without the argument, surrender simply shows your current
surrender level.
