.SH Name
.SI 5
ealias - Edit an alias in the Discworld alias system
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
ealias <alias>
ealias new <alias>
ealias copy <alias> to <new alias>
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The basic form of this command will read an existing alias into the line
editor and allow you to edit it, saving the edited alias in place of the
old one.

You can also create a 'new' alias directly and begin editing it immediately.

This command also allows you to 'copy' an existing alias to a new alias name and
edit the new version, so long as the new name isn't already an alias.

Note that when editing an existing alias, there may be a surplus '$*$' sequence.  It is added to the end of aliases created with 'alias', if not specified within them.  You may need to delete it.
