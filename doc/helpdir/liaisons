Discworld Liaisons are links between coders and players.  Rather than spend all our time locked in a room coding, we do our best to keep things running smoothly for everyone, and help keep communication flowing.

If you have a problem with the game, find a bug, need help, or want to suggest an idea - run it past a Liaison, and we'll do our best to help you.

For a list of current liaisons, try '%^BOLD%^finger liaison%^RESET%^'.
