.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The fairy godmothers will help you become unstuck or unlost, by
transporting you back to a safe location known to you.  If you are in a room
with no exits or you are less than 50th level in your guild,
then transport is free.  If you are above this level, they may
require some payment.
