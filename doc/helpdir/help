.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Discworld features a rich and sophisticated help system.  Information is
available on a wide variety of topics and is accessible in many 
different ways.
.EP

.SH Concept Help
.SP 5 5
Typing 'help' by itself or 'help concepts' will provide a list of Discworld
concepts.  An individual concept can be accessed by typing 'help
<concept>'.

Each concept covers a high-level feature of Discworld and will typically
refer to any commands or related concepts for further information.
.EP

.SH Command Help
.SP 5 5
Discworld features a wide range of commands.  Some are available all the
time while others may be specific to a location or item.  The general
commands can be listed using 'help command_list' and the details of a
particular command can be viewed using 'help <topic>'.

Spells, rituals and souls also have their own help which you can read with
'help <spell|ritual|soul>'.

Occasionally there may be a clash between two help topics.  To get help
explicitly on a spell, ritual, soul or command when there is a class  can
put use spell, ritual, soul or command in front of the name.
e.g. 'help spell calm'.

.SH Context Sensitive Help
.SP 5 5
A new feature that is being added to Discworld is the ability for objects
and places to have their own help.  To access this information use 'help
here' or 'help <object>'.  These pages will provide information about the
specific location or object.  e.g.: typing 'help here' in a shop will show
the help page for shops and provide information on how to use a shop.
.EP

.SH Help System Features
.SP 5 5
The Discworld help system has a number of advanced features to help you
find the right files.

Discworld has an extensive list of synonyms.  e.g.: help
fighters will show the guilds concept help file.  In addition if there is no
help file for the subject you request Discworld uses a spellcheck algorithm
to try to identify help files that might be relevant.

.SH Caveats
.SP 5 5
Note that the help is being written and maintained by overworked and
stressed creators, so errors may slip in, or things may change without
being reflected in the help.  If you notice something like this, please
report the error with the 'bug help <name>' command.
