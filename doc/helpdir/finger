Finger is primarily used to provide information about players and creators. It returns information such as when they were last on, or since when they have been logged on for, how long they have been idle for (if at all), their real name, location, email address and birthday (if they entered them), how old their character is, what guild they are in etc. etc.

With no arguments finger will provide a list of who is currently on Discworld giving their name, real name, location and birthday. The second field is
[T]rustee, [D]irector, [S]enior creator, [C]reator, [p]laytester - normal players have no flag, and [X] means they haven't entered the game yet, anyone can also be using [e]armuffs.

Finger can be forced to show information on clubs and families by putting
the keywork 'club' or 'family' in front of the name you wish to finger.
