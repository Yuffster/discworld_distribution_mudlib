What do all these things mean?  Well, they all specify how the command
will be parsed.  The things inside '<' and '>' are special matching
specifiers.  They can be one of the following below:
.EP
.SO 5 20 -30
	object	Any object in your inventory or on the ground.
	any-living	Any living person anywhere in the game, this allows you to deal with people not in the same room with you.
	distant-living	Any living object that is not in the same room as you.
	living	Any living person in the same room with you.
	preposition	A preposition is a sort of joining word.  They are things like 'on', 'from', 'under', just put in what feels most comfortable to you.
	string	A collection of words.  Will match 1 or more words.
	word	A single word.
	number	A number, the number must be in numerical format.  It does not handle numbers as words (currently).
	fraction	A special sort of number, it is specified as something like 12/2, or whatever.
.EO
.SP 5 5

If the words are enclosed in '{' and '}' then it is a list of required
words.  For instance if there was a {bing|red|blue} in the pattern string,
then the pattern would match either bing, red or blue in that place.  One
of these words MUST be there for the pattern to match.

If the words are enclosed in '[' and ']' then it is a list of optional
words.  It is parsed the same as the list above, except this parameter
is optional and you do not need to fill it in.

Inside the '[', ']'
something may be specified in '<', '>'.  They have the same meaning
as in the '<', '>' table shown above, except they are optional.

If there is nothing enclosing the words.  Then they are required
parameter and they must be typed in as shown.

Good luck! - Pinkfish.
