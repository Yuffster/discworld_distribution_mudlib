.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command informs the creators of typos in commands, spells, objects (room
items, normal items, NPCs, etc.), rituals, help files, rooms, help files or
in general.  The first argument is used to specify what type of typo report
it is, while the second is the name of the command, spell, etc.  The
second argument is not used for rooms as "here" is implicit, it's also not
used for general reports.

The typo report is recorded in a database specific to whatever you are using
the command for, so try to be specific in your use.

If you have to report a typo in a spell you haven't remembered at the
moment, you can use the name of one you have, as all spells are bugfixed by
the same creator, so the report will still go to the right person.  The same
is true for rituals.

To report typos in rooms just stand in them and use the command.

To report typos in objects be VERY SPECIFIC.  For example, if you've got three
swords, don't use 'typo object sword' because the typo report will go to the
first sword even if it's not the one with the typo.  Instead, make sure
which one has the typo and use something like 'typo object sword 2',
or you can use its full name, i.e. 'typo object sword of doom'.

Specially for creators: the object can be specified by filename.

To report typos in commands, spells and rituals, just put the name of
the command or spell as you know it as the second argument.

To report typos in a help file, use 'bug help <name>', PLEASE only use this
for reporting typos in helpfiles.
