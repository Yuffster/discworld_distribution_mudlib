.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to change the default spoken language.  At the
start you will only know the language of your chosen nationality and grunt.

If you speak your chosen language in your homeland, chances are there will be
a large number of locals who will understand you.  If you speak it abroad,
however, there will be a smaller chance that you will be understood by
the citizens of that land, since not all of them will have learned
your nation's tongue.  As time goes on you will probably have opportunities
to learn new languages.  

Grunt is also a special language.  It is a language everyone can speak
but no one can understand.  So, if you speak grunt no one else will
understand you.  This is the language you will speak if you forget
all your others.

Languages have different properties, for example not all languages are
spoken, and not all languages are written.
