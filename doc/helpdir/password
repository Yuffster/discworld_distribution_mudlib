.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command will prompt you for your old password then, assuming you get it
right, will let you enter your new password.  It will then ask you to type it
again to make sure you got it right the first time.  It then forces you to
save so your new password is immediately stored.

Please also read the rules regarding the use, sharing and replacement of
passwords!

.SH Tips for choosing passwords
.SI 5
Don't use something you'd find in a dictionary (in any language or
jargon).  Don't use a name (including that of a spouse, parent, child,
pet, fantasy character, famous person, and location) or any variation
of your personal or mud name.

Don't use accessible information about you (such as your phone number,
license plate, or social security number) or your environment.  Don't
use a birthday or a simple pattern (such as backwards, followed by a
digit, or preceded by a digit.

Instead, use a mixture of upper and lower case letters, as well as
digits or punctuation.  When choosing a new password, make sure it's
unrelated to any previous password. Use long passwords (say 8
characters long).  You might use a word pair with punctuation
inserted, a passphrase (an understandable sequence of words), or the
first letter of each word in a passphrase.

If someone guesses your password they can take your character and destroy it
