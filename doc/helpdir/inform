.SH Description
.SP 5 5
With this command you set which special messages you are informed of.  If you
specify no arguments it will tell you what you are currently being informed
of and whether inform is on or off.

The inform messages can be repressed or unrepressed by going inform off and
inform
on.  Repressing the inform messages does not change which types of messages
you will be informed of.  Just stops you being told about them until you turn
them on again.

The all keyword makes you be informed of all possible event types.  You can
specificaly turn on and off informing of certain types of events.  If you
do not specify whether it should be on or off it toggles the status of
the event.  To find out all the possible types you can be informed of
try inform all :)
