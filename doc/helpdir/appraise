.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Appraise will give you some details of a single item you are carrying gleaned from a cursory glance of the object, such as the materials it is made out of, possible uses for the item, and an estimation of length and width.

This command is intended as a supplement to look, as these details often get missed to keep the descriptions readable.  Please note that as many items are older than the code for features (such as length and weight), you may find appraise often gives obviously inaccurate results - in these cases it is best to file a bug report on the object in question.
