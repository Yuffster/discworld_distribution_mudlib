.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This is similar to tell, except it only works in the current room and it
tells everyone else in the room that you whispered to the person, but not
what.  This command is great for inducing paranoia.

The # and @ can be used to use a specific language and an adverb to the
message.  You can use partial matching for a language, so for example
#dj will make you speak in djelian.  You may also put the language name
in quotes after the # to speak in languages which have spaces in them.
