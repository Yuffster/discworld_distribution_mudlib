.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Locate will find everything in your environment (i.e. everything in the
same places as you) and in your inventory (i.e. everything you're
carrying that is not inside something else) that matches the words you
provide.  It will list these objects with the number you'd need to use
to refer to this specific object, together with whether each object is
currently worn or wielded.  If only one object is found, it gives its
location and whether it is being worn or wielded.
