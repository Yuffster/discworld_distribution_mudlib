.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to setup a list of sites (IP addresses) from which
your character can login. This can help prevent unauthorised use of your
character.

When someone tries to login your character the system will check your IP
address against your allow list. If the address is not on the allow list
they will not be permitted to login.

Allow lists can be used in two ways.  You can setup a list of addresses
from which you are allowed to login or you can setup a list of addresses
from which you are not allowed to login. Removing all addresses will
disable the access control function.

permit groups of addresses partial addresses may be given (eg. 127.0).
