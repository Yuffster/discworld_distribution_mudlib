.SH Description
In the words of the Jargon File (online version 4.3.1):

[...] The simple Caesar-cypher encryption that replaces each
English letter with the one 13 places forward or back along
the alphabet, so that "The butler did it!" becomes "Gur ohgyre
qvq vg!" [...]  It is used to enclose the text in a sealed wrapper
that the reader must choose to open -- e.g., for posting things
that might offend some readers, or spoilers.  A major advantage
of rot13 over rot(N) for other N is that it is self-inverse, [...].

Please note that this command should not be used as an excuse to
post things that would normally be against the rules.
