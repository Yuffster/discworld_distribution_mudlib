.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Nicknames are used to refer to objects by a nickname.  To use it, you just 
setup a nickname for any object by typing "nickname lyn lynscar" or whatever.
To use the nickname, just put the nickname in any command where you would 
normally put the object's entire name.  "dnickname" is used to delete a 
nickname.  "nickname" with no parameters will list all the nicknames you
have currently defined.

.SH Caution
.SP 5 5
Nicknames are quite often the cause for commands, spells and rituals
to stop working the way they should.  For instance, a "nickname red
redjack" will make it impossible to cast any spells or rituals that require
you to have a red candle.  Likewise, "nickname an annabel" will mess
up (amongst many other things) Pragi's Fiery Gaze because you need
an eye to cast that spell.  Always consider if a nickname could cause
problems.
