The chfn command lets you change the information that is printed when
someone fingers you.  It prompts you for all the information.  None of it is
compulsory, but the email address is desirable.  If you do not want anyone
other than admin and creators being able to see your email address, just put a
colon before the address, eg :fred@frog.frog.frog.edu

Please note that you can only set your birthday once using this method, if
you make a mistake, it can be changed by using options
