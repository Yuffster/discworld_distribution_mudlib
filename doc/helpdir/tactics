.SH Description
.SP 5 5
There are a number of combat options that you can set to determine your
tactics in a fight - you can change these settings at any time, even
during the middle of a fight, to change your tactics.  The first option
is your attitude: you can be on the offensive (in which case you get a
bonus to attacking, but a penalty to dodging and parrying), or on the
defensive (in which case you get a bonus to dodging and parrying, but a
penalty to attacking) or you can take a neutral attitude (in which case
there are no bonuses or penalties).
.EP

.SP 5 5
In dealing with an attack, you can choose your response: you can
always dodge or you can always parry or you can be neutral in your
response. When using neutral response there is a slight bonus since
your opponent doesn't know if you will dodge or parry.
.EP

.SP 5 5
For parrying, you can choose whether to always parry with the weapon,
or shield, in your left or right hand or always attempt to use the
weapons, or weapon and shield, in both hands.
.EP

.SP 5 5
If you are fighting unarmed, you can choose to attempt to parry with your
arm or hand (this special manoeuvre can be disabling if you are not
skillful enough, but would prevent an attack from reaching your more
vital areas).
.EP

.SP 5 5
You can control your mercy: always accept surrenders, never accept
surrenders, or ask whether or not to accept surrenders.
.EP 

.SP 5 5
You can focus on a specific part of an opponents body. While this
makes it more difficult to hit the opponent you may manage to injure
that body part enough to make it unusable. With different races the
part you have chosen to target will be mapped onto that races body.
.EP

.SP 5 5
It is important to realise that for best results, the tactics that you
choose should depend on your armoury, your opponents and the armouries
of your opponents - no two fights will ever be quite the same.

.SH Note
.SP 5 5
The distance and mercy options are currently disabled, they may be enabled in
the future.

Character Profiles
.SP 5 5
Alice the Assassin wears typical assassin's clothing, but carries around
rather a lot of the hardware typical to the trade.  After a successful
inhumation, she wields a rapier and a dagger and attempts to make good
her escape from the scene.  Since she is mostly interested in getting
away, she sets her combat attitude to defensive; given the weight of the
tools that she carries, she sets her combat response to parry and
chooses to always parry with the dagger in her left hand in order to
protect her more delicate rapier.
.EP

.SP 5 5
Birzig the Barbarian wears the standard leather garment, a cloak made
from the wool of Hublandish sheep and a pair of fur-lined boots.  He
carries little beyond a small satchel and his trusty bastard sword.
Since his goal is to defeat his enemies, he sets his combat attitude to
offensive and his response to neutral, since given the little he carries he
can either dodge or parry with his bastard sword.
