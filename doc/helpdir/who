.SH Description
.SP 5 5
When used with no parameters who give a short list of who is online.

When used with the 'verbose' parameter it gives the long information about who
is online, shows their status, their guild rank and any other pertinent
information.

Optionally you can provide a list of filters to show in which case only members
of the filter you give are listed.  The list can include the names of any
of the guilds you know and love plus "creators", "liaisons",
"adventurers", "playtesters", "killers", "friends", "families" or
nationality (morporkian, agatean etc.)  If you specific a '-' in front of the
name of the filter (ie: -creator) then it will show the members that are
not in that filter list.

You can find out details on all the people in the room with the 'who here'
command.  It will give you guild details and information on the people in
the room with you.

You can show an intersection of people on as well using the '&' connector.
So 'who killers & thieves' would show all the player killer thieves.
