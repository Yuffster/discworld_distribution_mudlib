.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Look is the command you use to get information on the things in your
environment and in your inventory.  On its own, it gives you the
description of your environment, that is, the location where you are.  If
you look at an object, you are given the long description for that
object.  You can also look into locations that are adjacent to your
current location, assuming that there are no obstacles such as closed
doors in the way, and in some places, like an open square, you can look
around to look at many neighbouring locations at once.
