.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command will attempt to put a weapon in the appropriate scabbard.
The command will fail if you don't have the appropriate scabbard
for your weapon (i.e.: you have a long sword, but your only scabbard
is for daggers), if your scabbard already has a weapon in it, or if
you don't have the weapon you're trying to sheathe.

This command is only available when you have a scabbard.
