.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command lets you know how much of your body you have protected.  With
no arguments, the command will only check armour and clothing that you are
wearing.  If you supply a list of body parts, the command will tell you
what, if anything, is protecting those bits.  You can also check which
areas of your body would be covered by selected items by specifying the
items as arguments.  Finally, the "unprotected" syntax will let you know
which of your bits are flapping in the breeze.
