Commands for the mailer. Womble on!

h [range] ............ Main menu (showing subjects and stuff). If you give a
		       range the subjects in the range will be displayed.
		       Otherwise as many as fit on your screen. "h all" will
		       show all subjects, even if that means you get 6 screens
		       at once :-).
m <name> ............. Mails to the given person(s).
r [num] .............. Replies to the message number or the last read message
                       if none given.
R [num] .............. As above but sends to the Cc's as well.
d [range] ............ Deletes a range of messages.
u [range] ............ Undeletes a range of messages.
f [num] <name> ....... Forwards the message to the person(s) given.
F [num] .............. Forwards the message to your E-mail address, if set.
                       Please make sure that this is a valid address!
> [range] <folder>.... Copies given message(s) to a folder. It will be created
                       if it didn't exist yet.
s [range] <filename> . Creators only: saves given message(s) to given file.
                       If no full pathname was given it will be saved in the
                       current directory(!). The resulting file is in E-mail
                       format, so it can be read by an E-mail program.
i .................... Index of your mail folders. You always have an inbox.
c <name> ............. Change to given folder (if it exists).
l .................... List the currently available mailing lists.
l <list> ............. List the members of the mailing list <list>.
L .................... Toggles showing of full/abbreviated header for
                       messages. The default is abbreviated.
q .................... Quit, the mailer will ask if you want to delete/move
                       marked/read messages. It asks if you want to move the
                       read messages from your inbox to the received folder.
? .................... Display this help file.
<num> ................ Display given message.

Return on a blank line will display the next unread message.

A range is defined as a list of comma seperated numbers or spans.
So "1-2" is defined as well as "1,2,3" and
"all" is a special case that means all messages, so "d all" is a valid command.
It does intelligent matching, so if there are 4 messages and you typed
"d 1-30" it will delete the 4 messages and will not complain.
You can execute all commands by just typing the letter, the mailer will then
explain what you have to type.
