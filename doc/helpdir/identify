.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command can be used to describe an object with a word/words
you choose yourself.  Items that have had an indicator specified are
shown as such by "locate".  An item's identifier is preserved over
logins, but not if the item leaves your inventory at any time.

Note: Leaving your inventory does not include being put into any
container, such as a backpack or a scabbard, unless this container
is not in your inventory (or leaves it).

The 'identify <object>' syntax will show the current identifier (if any)
for the object.
