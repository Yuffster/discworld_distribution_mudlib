.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The map command will show your surroundings while you're travelling in a terrain environment.  These are areas where you can 'walk' or 'journey' in certain directions.  These are all explained in 'help terrain room'.

Symbols are used to represent different terrain, such as roads, forest and plains, which will correlate with what you see by looking around you.  The map is centred on your location, marked with a %^YELLOW%^yellow%^RESET%^ symbol.  The map will only show what is in your line of sight at the time.
