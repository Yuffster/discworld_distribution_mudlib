.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command gives a quick listing of who is currently online, only
displaying names.

There is an optional second argument to qwho which displays only
players of a certain guild or 'killers'.  This is the same set of
options as used in who.   If you specific a '-' in front of the
name of the filter (ie: -creator) then it will show the members that are
not in that filter list.

You can show an intersection of people on as well using the '&' connector.
So 'qwho killers & thieves' would show all the player killer thieves.
