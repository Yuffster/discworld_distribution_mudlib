History is used to review the most recent commands you have typed.  You can
also redo these commands in a number of ways.  Each of the commands in the
history list has a number next to it.

If you type
 >history
 
You'll get a list of your last commands
These can be navigated with commands like 

>history 150

Which will give commands from number 150 onwards, if more commands are needed,

>history 150,190

Will give the history between the two numbers

Typing

> .34

Will redo command number 34.  If you type

> .ki

It will execute the most recent command that is remembered that begins with the
letters ki.  Also, as a shortcut, the command

> ..

will execute the most recent command.  That being the last one you typed.

Using the syntax ^word1^word2^ you can do a search and replace on the last
command typed replacing every occurrence of word1 with word2.
