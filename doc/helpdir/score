.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Score gives you an indication of your current condition.  Choosing
"brief" will give you the short version, while "verbose" will give
you the longer; if you don't specify, it defaults to your current
mode.  The option "stats" will cause your stats to be shown, rather
than your general score information.  All of these horrible numbers
are used all over the place to calculate your general well-being.  You
can also gloat over your achievements with the "quests" option and
check your alignment with the "align" option.

The "score quests sorted" command displays your quests in an alphabetically
sorted list.

You can use the "score relationships" command to show your relationship to
other members of your family.  You cannot use this if you are not in a family,
and if you want more information such as inter-family relationships then you
will have to use the "finger" command.

The "score fighting" command shows which NPCs or players you are
currently fighting. (If any.)

You can use the command "gp" to show your current distribution
of guild points.
