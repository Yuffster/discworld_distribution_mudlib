.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The cols command is used to set the number of columns of the terminal that you
are using to play the mud.  The default depends on your terminal type, if it
is set to "network" and your terminal supports it there should be no need to
use this command.  If you use another terminal type or if your terminal doesn't
support the "network" terminal type it is set to 79.  This is also the value
used if you try to set it to anything that is not a valid value.
Typing just cols will print the current value.
