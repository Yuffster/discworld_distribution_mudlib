.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command lets you haunt a location or a person.  Death is a very complicated process, allowing you to expand your horizons and see straight through time.  Nevertheless, it is often necessary to get your own back at a particular beasty or person that has caused your untimely demise.

You must be dead to use the haunt command.

Note: If you find the frantic cries of the dead distressing, you can block their hauntings with either with remote-soul earmuffs or by use of the ignore command.
