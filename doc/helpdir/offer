.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This will offer an object for sale to another player.  The offer will be
handled securely, so that the hand over of the object and the money
will happen with no loss.

The types of the money will be determined by the price you set, so if
you say the price in AM dollars, then the person must pay in AM dollars.  Any
change you get back from the transaction will be in AM dollars as well.

The other player must then accept the transaction for it to successfully
go through.  You can withdraw the transaction before it is completed if
you do not wish to continue to offer the items for sale.
