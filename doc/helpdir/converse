.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Converse is usefull when you want to send a large amount of text.  When you
type converse, your prompt will change.  Anything you type will be said.  This
saves you typing say each time.  If you want to do something that is not a say,
then you type ! first.  To finish the converse session, type **.

If you use the converse <name> version of converse it does the same thing
but with tells.  So instead of saying everything you type in it tells
everything to the person being targeted.
