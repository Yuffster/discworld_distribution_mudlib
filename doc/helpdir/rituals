.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command shows what rituals you know.  The use of a certain ritual is
granted to a person by a god - automatically to a priest of that god,
while non-priest worshippers must undertake certain tasks to earn the
god's respect.  NB: in dying, your mind loses its connection to your god,
so you will forget the rituals you know if you die and need to be
retaught them after being resurrected.

It is possible for non-priests to learn some rituals.
