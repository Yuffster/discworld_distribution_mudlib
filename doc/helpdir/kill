.SH Description
.SP 5 5
Kill is the command used to initiate combat with monsters and other players.
Once combat has started, you will hit the monsters automatically and be able
to use commands and spells given to you by your guild.  If a monster starts a
fight with you, there is probably little you can do other than kill it or run
for your life.

A trick that is useful when referencing living things is to use the 'living'
adjective.  This will make sure you reference the living troll and not the
corpse of the troll on the ground in front of you.

As with most commands that use skills, the kill command costs guild points.
