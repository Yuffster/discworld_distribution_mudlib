.SH Name
.SI 5
relationship - control your family relations
.EI

.SH Syntax
.SI 5
relationship <relationship> with <person>
relationship <relationship> with <person> and join family
relationship list
.EI

.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command sets up your relationships with everyone else.   The relationship
you specify in the command is your relationship with them.  So if you are
trying to become someone's parent you should set this relationship as
parent.

The list option to the relationship command will show you the list of
available relationships that you can setup with other people.  Remember!
Families are for life, not just the afternoon.

If the join family option is specified then the person you are asking for
a relationship will also join your family.  This will only have any real
effect if the person you are setting up a relationship with is already
in a family.  If someone is not in a family then setting up a relationship
with them automatically joins them into the family.

You can change families without setting up a new relationship if you already
have a relationship with someone and specify that as your relationship.
The 'and join family' section of the command must also be appended to
cause the change of family.  A person in the family you wish to change into
must be the one that sets up the relationship and invites you into the
family.

The syntax of the accept command will be displayed when the relationship
is initiated.
