.SH Description
.SP 5 5
The bug replies system handles displaying and replying to all the bug replies
seperate from the mail system.  The menu has a few possible commands, they
are: 'h' print the help, 'r' reply to the message, 'd' delete the message,
'u' undelete the message, 'l' to list the messages and 'q' quit the system.

If you press return at the prompt it will try and read the next unread
note by default.

The 'u' and 'd' commands can take a range so you can type in 1-3 to delete
the messages from position 1 to position 3.
