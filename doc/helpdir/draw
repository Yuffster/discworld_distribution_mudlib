.SH Description
.SP 5 5
This command will attempt to pull a weapon out of its scabbard and
equip it.  It will fail if you don't have a scabbard that contains
the weapon, or if you can't equip the weapon.

If you draw a two-handed weapon, or you are currently holding a
two-handed weapon, you will put it down in order to hold the new
weapon.

This command is only available when you have a scabbard.
