With the show command, you can allow someone to inspect
an item in your inventory closely, without having to
give it directly to him, and risk losing it.

.SP 5 5
You offer an item to a player who is in the same room and is
able to see you.  If the player wants to take a look at the
item, he accepts the offer.
.EP
 
.SP 5 5
You can simultaneously have an offer to more than one person, but you
can only have one offer per person at a time.  If you try to show a
person something, and there is already an offer by you pending to
that person, the older one is removed and replaced by the newer
offer.
.EP

.SP 5 5
If the item has something that can be read on it, the player
the item is being shown to will automatically attempt to read it,
should he choose to accept the offer using the \"read\" option.

This help file will automatically destruct in five seconds.

> show quill to gruper
You offer the quill to Gruper for inspection.

[Gruper would see:]
Tape offers you a quill for inspection.  Use
"show accept offer from <living>" to view it.

> show accept offer from tape

You accept Tape's offer.
Tape shows a quill to you.

This is a nice, long, feathery quill.  You could "write" on things with it. 
You could probably even "copy" writing that you find.
It is in excellent condition.
