.SH Description
.SP 5 5
During combat, other players and NPCs may occasionally offer a
surrender to you.  This generally occurs because you're
soundly whupping their butt, but there are other possible causes.

If you are feeling in a dastardly mood today, you can reject their
surrender with this command.  You will be told precisely what you need
to type to reject their surrender when the surrender is offered.
