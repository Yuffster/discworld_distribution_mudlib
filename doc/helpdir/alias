have defined name to be be.

The third format, alias with part of a name after it will show all
your currently defined aliases that start with the text given.

The fourth format, alias <name> <definition> will set name to the
definition you have passed to it.

The fifth format, alias sorted, will print an alphabetically sorted
list of the current aliases you have.

There is a special alias that is called on login, called 'login'.  If
you alias this to something it will be run as soon as you
login.  The plan and project information for finger is done inside the
alias command.  These are the aliases .plan and .project, and can be up
to five lines long.  Refers use the alias .reference and can be up to
20 lines long. If you want a signature appended to your mails and posts
to boards, create an alias of .signature.
