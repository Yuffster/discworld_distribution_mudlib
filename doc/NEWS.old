   The Discworld FAQ is now available!  Point your WWW browser at
    http://discworld.imaginary.com:5678/ to take a look at it or 
       try "help faq".  Read this if you happen to be NEW to
                     Discworld and/or mudding.                  

     Do NOT ask for QUEST HINTS.  Yep, this means YOU as well!

     It is every player's responsibility to be aware of the RULES.
     Read "help rules" NOW.  Ignorance of the rules will not be 
     considered an excuse for breaking them.     

     Before you ask a creator a question that does not relate to
     an error read "help creators".  Not doing so will result in
     irony, if warranted possibly even sarcasm.
