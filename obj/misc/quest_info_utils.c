  Function : General inheritable for use by anything really.
             Using quest_info stuff is a bit of a pain. This
             is just syntactic sugar to make it a lot more
             friendly.


Quest info is saved as a mapping, so you can index any info you like
under named keys.

Functions:
----------
set_quest_name(string quest_name)
   sets the name of the quest this item applies to.

void set_quest_param(mixed player, string key, mixed value)
   Sets the quest info value addressed by <key> to <value>
   Value can be of any type.

mixed query_quest_param(mixed player, string key)
   gets the quest info value addressed by <key>

void clear_quest_info(mixed player)
   Clears all the quest info associated with <player>
   for the current quest
