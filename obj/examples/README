This here is a suite of rooms hopefully helping you through the first
stages of creation on this mud. Please realise they are very Discworld
specific, so read them even if you are an experienced Creator from
another mud or muds. Hopefully, they are not too patronising, but
realise they were designed for all levels of newbie Creator (including
those with no coding knowledge -- *cringe*).
Problems should be directed to me (that is Bil, if you are not telepathic)

Note: do NOT simply copy these rooms and remove the comments and
      change the descriptions. Apart from being a lot of work it is best
      if you just go into 'ed' and write it from scratch. In the long
      run it gets you better aqainted with the code, and it really isn't
      as hard as changing my stuff. DO however use them as templates for
      your own rooms in preference to other Creator's stuff (which might
      be wrong! - or at least more wrong that I am *8-)*
