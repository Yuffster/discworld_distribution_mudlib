This is the directory in which the house layouts are written.

Each directory contains one template. Any directory which ends with the
letter 'M' means that template contains multiple houses (e.g. a duplex or
block of flats).

Within each directory are a number of files. Each file corresponds to a
single room. Each file starts with N. The N will be replaced by the house
number (so you could have several houses in a particular area each with a
different number so they don't get mixed up). If there are multiple houses
in the directory they will be indicated by a letter after the
N. e.g. Nagarden.c Naliving.c Nafluff.c are all part of house Na and
Nbgarden.c Nbliving.c Nbfluff.c are all part of the house Nb. Finally the
room will have a name e.g. livingroom, bedroom1, etc.

The code for the house rooms is normal LPC code except that information
that will vary has been replaced with %<name>%. These fields are
substituted when you use the housing creator. The following substitutions
are available:

  %savedir% -- the directory for the houses save files
  %N% -- the house number
  %orientation% -- 1 if the house is oriented on a diagonal, 0 otherwise.
  %out% -- the destination of the exit onto the street.
  %1% - %7% -- the directions as follows:  7 0 1
                                            \|/
                                           6-+-2  
                                            /|\
                                           5 4 3
               these relative directions will be mapped to cardinal
               directions by the housing creator.

A typical room will look something like this:

    #include "path.h";
    inherit PLAYER_HOUSE;
    
    void setup() {
       set_light(50);
       set_theft_handler( HOSPITAL );
       set_save_file("%savedir%/%N%bed");
       
       /* DESCRIPTIONS */
       set_orientation(%orientation%);
       set_quit_handler(%out%);
    
       set_short("bedroom");
       set_base_desc( "a small bedroom" );
       add_surface( "floor", "stone paving" );
       add_surface( "ceiling", "roughly finished wood" );
       add_surface( "%0% wall", "roughly finished wood" );
       add_surface( "%2% wall", "roughly finished wood" );
       add_surface( "%4% wall", "roughly finished wood" );
       add_surface( "%6% wall", "roughly finished wood" );
    
       /* EXITS */
    
       add_exit( "%4%", PATH +"%N%livingroom", "door" );
       modify_exit("%4%", ({ "door short", "living room door" }));
    }

The base description is put at the beginning of the rooms generated
description, it only needs to be brief description, the full description
will be auto-generated.

6 surfaces should be present -- floor, ceiling, %0%, %2%, %4% and
%6%. Ceiling will not be present in an outside room of course.

Doors should be given a short description typically involving the room the
door leads to. Do not mark doors as open, closed, locked, unlocked or
having any keys since this is all handled by the housing system.
