Notes for armour
================

These are just some notes to use as a guide when creating new armour.


Damage resistance
-----------------

Types of armour should have the following levels of resistance:

        blunt   sharp  pierce
plate   excel   excel  excel
chain   bad     v.good medium
hleath  good    medium bad
leath+  +++     ++     +
leather bad     poor   bad
bone    good    bad    bad

hleath is hard leather. leath+ is all those leather + bits of
metal/whatever. Use your judgement, but basically the more metal the
better blunt will become, sharp will go up more slowly than blunt and
pierce even more slowly.


Armour types
============

Armour is divided into three basic types, leather, flexible (maille) and hard
(plate). Players can wear both maille & plate at the same time.

All your items should be one (or more) of these types.
Note: an item may be of more than one type. For example a basinet may
have a set_type of: set_type(({"helmet", "gorget"})); to give it
coverage for both the head and neck.

leather
-------
The leather armour is somewhere between clothing & armour, thus it
uses clothing types.
hat (head)
jacket (chest, back, arms)
trousers (abdomen, legs)

flexible (maille)
-----------------
coif (head & neck)
byrnie (chest + back + abdomen)
haubergon (chest + back + abdomen + arms)
hauberk (chest + back + adbdomen + arms + legs)
chausses (feet)

hard (plate)
------------
helmet (head)
gorget (neck)
breastplate (chest + abdomen)
backplate (back)
vambraces (arms)
greaves (legs)
sabatons (feet)

basinet {helmet + gorget}
cuirass {breastplate + backplate}


Gloves & boots are extra. You can't wear maille & plate gloves or
boots -- ouch!
