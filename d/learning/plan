The main idea is to get a lot of objects and rooms commented and put here
with properties "commented functions" and "keywords" that will be queried by
the search handler when it's asked to update its database of files to search
for.

The "commented functions" property is an array of the names of the
functions whose use are commented in the file.

The "keywords" are for a more concept/idea/problem oriented search mechanism.

Examples of objects should also have a room so it's possible to go there to
see the example.
