If you need to ask something else, or have problems of any kind,
the Liaison creators will kindly help you out, if you ask nicely. 
To see if any are logged on, simply type  '%^YELLOW%^liaisons%^RESET%^'. 
Also, most of the players are usually very helpful when it comes to
answering questions.

simply teach yourself.  Type  '%^YELLOW%^help level%^RESET%^' and
