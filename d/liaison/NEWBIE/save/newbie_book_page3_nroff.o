These are often waiting by the guilds or in the Mended Drum.  To use one you say in the same room as one, for example: 'take me to wizards guild please'.  Other places they can take you to, besides the guilds, are 'the post office', 'the bank', 'least gate' and 'hubwards gate'You start off with a total of eight lives.  If you should happen to die Harry at the Temple of Small Gods, can raise you from the dead and you are then set to go again (one life shorter).  Some player Priests also have the ability to resurrect.  Once resurrected, you'll have a new body but will need to go back to your corpse to recover your equipment.And please BUG report bugs and typos you see.
