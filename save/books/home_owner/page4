.SH Notes
.SP 5 5
Only one piece of furniture can be placed in a location, 
although other pieces of furniture can be placed "at", 
or "near" it.

When hanging objects, the 'verb' must be specified.

You cannot place pieces of furniture on top of each other, 
but you can "put" objects on top of certain pieces of 
furniture.  What is on the piece of furniture will be 
displayed in the long description of the room only if is a 
single object or a group of the same objects.  This will 
only be displayed if the furniture is placed in a location, 
not "at" or "near" another piece of furniture.  This is 
to avoid room descriptions becoming too long.
