.SH Theft
.SP 5 5
Theft from your home is always an unfortunate event.  To avoid theft 
make sure that all your valuables are kept in a locked container.

A thief may not pick the lock on a container in a home or take the 
furniture from a home if the owner of the home is not also a PK.  
However, a thief is able to take any items that are lying on the floor 
or in un-locked containers.

Taking items from open containers constitutes theft and, 
in Ankh-Morpork, will count towards the thief's quota.

This leads to some slightly unexpected results.  If a non-thief takes 
something from a table in your home they will find that they have 
committed unlicensed theft!

We hope that this arrangement strikes a good balance between the 
rights of thieves to steal and the rights of owners to protect their 
property.
