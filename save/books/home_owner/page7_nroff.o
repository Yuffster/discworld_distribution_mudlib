Any furniture that is  left in the house will save, as will any items left in, or on, that  furniture, but a dagger left on the floor will not.In addition, while every attempt has been made to make sure homes do  not lose their inventory, due to their size, complexity and storage  capacity they are not as reliable as vaults so please treat them  accordingly.
