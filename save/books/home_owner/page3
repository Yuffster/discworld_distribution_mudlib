.SH Furnishing
.SP 5 5
You can buy furniture at a furniture shop and then place it around 
your home. All furniture placed in your home will be saved with the 
room and so will still be there when you return (assuming it hasn't 
been stolen -- see theft and also saving).

Since furniture is hard to carry you'll probably have to 'drag' it.  In 
future there will be delivery and perhaps a hand-cart 
available to make this easier.

.SH Placing furniture
.SP 5 5
You may "place" furniture in the rooms of your 
home.  The syntax for "place" is: 
.EP

.SI 7
place <furniture> so that it is <verb> <preposition> the <location>
place <furniture> so that it is <preposition> the <location>
.EI

.SP 5 5
'Furniture' is the piece of furniture you are attempting to 
place.  'Verb' is an optional argument that allows you to 
place things "sitting", "standing", "squatting", etc. if 
appropriate to the piece of furniture that you are trying 
to place.  'Preposition' allows you to specify if a piece of 
furniture is "against" or "beside" a wall, "in" a corner, 
etc.  'Location' can be either a location in the room (e.g. 
"north wall", "southwest corner", "center of the room", 
etc) or a piece of furniture (e.g. "table 2").

You can also use "place help" or "place help <furniture" to get 
information about exactly where you can place furniture, or a specific 
piece of furniture.
