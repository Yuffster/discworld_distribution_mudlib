.SP 5 5
In each room the walls, floor and ceiling may be decorated.  To do 
this you will need to buy a brush and paint.  You will then be able 
to paint surfaces in your home with 'paint <surface> with <paint>'.

In future a wider range of coverings will be available including 
carpets and wall paper.
