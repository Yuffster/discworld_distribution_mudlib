At the locksmiths you may purchase locks for the doors in your 
home.  The locks come as a package of a lock and a key.  Take the lock 
out of the package and then use the command 'change lock in <exit> for 
<lock name>'. You may then lock and unlock the door with the key 
 provided.

You may also buy locks for furniture.  The syntax for putting these 
locks in place is the same as for doors.

Note that the more expensive locks are generally harder to pick.

For additional security you may purchase traps for the locks in your 
home.  A trap can be added to a lock using 'rig <item> with <trap 
name>'.  Be careful though, rigging a trap is a difficult task and, 
if done by the inexpert, can result in injury or even death.  You may 
wish to get someone with a good knowledge of traps to do this for you.

All of the traps currently on sale are only triggered when the lock is 
picked (or the safe is cracked) so you don't have to worry about it 
going off when you open the lock with your key.  In future a wider 
variety of traps will be available, some of which may be triggered by 
opening the item.
