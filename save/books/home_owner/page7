.SH Saving
.SP 5 5
As mentioned previously, your home is not just a huge vault.  It will 
not save items that are dropped on the floor.  Any furniture that is 
left in the house will save, as will any items left in, or on, that 
furniture, but a dagger left on the floor will not.

In addition, while every attempt has been made to make sure homes do 
not lose their inventory, due to their size, complexity and storage 
capacity they are not as reliable as vaults so please treat them 
accordingly.
