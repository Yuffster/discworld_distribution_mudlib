No one has ever managed to come up with a plan, that from beginning to end makes sense and allows everyone to see the incredible purpose and direction it follows.  It is this lack of direction and this lack of a purpose which causes all other world peace plans to fail.  In this treatise I outline a method for achieving sure and lasting world peace in a practical and useful manner. ","Ideology",3,5,5,"The ideology, the essential ingredient to all plans.  This is needed to hold up the basic ideas behind world peace, to show us what we are trying to achieve and how we are going about it.  The ideology of world peace is sure and lasting peace, where no one is killed any more (except when buildings fall on them or when the assassins guild rightfully removes a paid for life [1]).  Other elements of world peace include not killing seals any more and being nice to spatulas. ","Method",3,5,5,"To bring about world peace you must lead by example, no more rampant killing of innocent cabbages or even children.  You must stay to the straight and narrow path of only killing those that really deserve it.  To this end the bologna path presents a fine and determined example.  Eating bologna shows to the world that you are a peaceful person, that you would not hurt seals or say a bad word to spatulas.  The carefully created image of bologna as instrumental in world peace is in part due to the fine efforts of the wizards guild[2], for who we are truly thankful.'Why bologna?' you may ask, well put simply it's an integral part of the universe and is often used in soups and sandwiches to hold the bread apart [3]. ","Conclusion",3,5,5,"In conclusion, eat bologna, be peaceful, collect spatulas and pat seals. ","Footnotes",3,5,5,"[1] Paid for by the assassins guild, all rights for killing reserved. ",3,5,5,"[2] The efforts of one Fiona Patternwalker have not gone unnoticed. ",3,5,5,"[3] We own a bologna shop. ","",})
