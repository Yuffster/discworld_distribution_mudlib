Why wizards?
.SP 5 5
Because wizards are too lazy to go off and beat up cute little adorable and
cuddly seals.  They have been seen (on occasion) torturing spatulas with
a frying pan, but we can forgive them this vice.

A special thanks has to go out to Keating at this point, for being a major
pivotal member in the bologna for World Peace action group.
