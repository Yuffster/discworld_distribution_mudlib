To make a lasting impression at parties, sit in the onion dip or stick
your head in the punchbowl and start slurping loudly. If all else fails,
perch yourself like a vulture on the arm of a sofa and leave all the
guests with the impression that if they don't finish all the
hours d'oevres soon, YOU will.
