.SH Setting up people for auotmatic acceptance
.SP 5 5
You can setup people so that items they sell have different limits to the
defaults.  This applies to the deny limit, the approve limit and the
number of items the shop will stock.

'approve limit deny value for <player> to <cost|disable>' sets the
deny limit for the player.  If they try and sell an item for more
than this it will be denied.  This can be higher or lower than the
default limit.  If this is disabled then
the default limit will be used.

'approve limit approve value for <player> to <cost|disable>' sets the
approve limit for the player.  If they try and sell an item for less
than this it will be automatically added to the shop inventory.  This can be
higher or lower than the default limit.  If this is disabled then
the default limit will be used.

'approve limit number for <player> to <number>' sets the
number of items the shop will stock for the player.  It will deny them
from selling more than this to the shop, this includes both the inventory
and anything they have waiting for acceptance.  This can be
higher or lower than the default limit.  If the number is set to 0 then
this will be disabled and the default limit will be used.

'approve status' will show you the current status of all the players
approval limits.
