.SH Money Handling
.SP 5 5
The very important bit of the shop, how do you get paid?  Well, the money
system uses the standard royalties system used in other craft shops around
the place.  You come into the shop and use the command 'collect royalties'
to collect your royalties.  The same goes for people who are selling items
in your shop.  Once you approve an item from them, the money goes into
their royalties box.

If items are setup for autoapproval then the person selling the item
immediately gets the money they should get and your royalties in the
shop are deducted.  If your royalties go below 0 then you need to
use 'approve pay deficit' to pay off your deficit before you can
do any other manipulations on the shop.

You can set the percentage that is added onto any item the player sells to
the shop (your profit) using the 'approve percentage <number>' command.

You can tell what your current percentage (and any auto approval rules)
from using the command 'approve status'
