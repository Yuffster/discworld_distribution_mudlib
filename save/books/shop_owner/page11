.SH Statistics
.SP 5 5
The shop keeps track of certain statistics about people who sell in the
shop.  It keeps track of which items are the best sellers and how much
money has been made on each item.  It also keeps track of every transaction
the shop makes (buying and selling) so it is possible to see where all
your money went or didn't go.

'stats items by name', 'stats itemn by value' and 'stats item by number'
are the methods for getting statistics on which items have sold better.  It
sorts on name, value or number.  Every month this information will be cleared
out and turned into a report.  This report will be sent to the player
who owns the shop.

'stats transactions' shows you the current list of transactions for the
shop.  This is sorted in time order.
