You also control how many items can be listed by each player and just about any other shop related feature you can think of.  Like how much markup you put on things.Unlike a normal craft shop players do not have control of the price of their items, they are paid for the cost of the item upfront when the shop buys it and then the shop owner controls the cost it is sold for.  The standard controls in the shop for changing of an item after it is in the shops inventory still work, but only for the shop owner, not for the owner of the item. ","",8,"Contents",7,5,"1  ....
