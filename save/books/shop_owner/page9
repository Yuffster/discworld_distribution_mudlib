.SH Setting up items for automatic acceptance
.SP 5 5
You can set limits on how much a shop will pay for specified items.  The shop
will deny anything which costs more than the specified amount.  The
shop will approve the item sold for less than the specified amount and
deny anything that is sold for more.

You can also use expressions using the expression items as discussed on
page 13.  These will work instead of a specific value on an item which is
set as a restriction to the shop.

'approve auto item add <name> up to <value>' sets the limit at which the
shop will accept the item sold for.  Because when specifing this, the
short description must exactly match and have the same case for this to
be triggered.

'approve auto item add <name> with <expression>' adds an expression
which will be evaluated as well when the item is attempted to be sold.
Please see page 13 and 14 for more information on expressions and
how to use them with items.

'approve auto item remove <name>' will remove the specified item from the
list of items to automatically approve for less than the specifed amount.

'approve auto item add object <object> up to <value>' this will check
through the objects and use their short descriptions to set up the matches.
You can use this method to try and cause the short descriptions to
match correctly.

'approve auto item add object <object> with <value>' adds an expression
which will be evaluated as well when the item is attempted to be sold.
Please see page 13 and 14 for more information on expressions and how
to use them with items.

'approve auto item remove object <object>' will remove the object
with the shorts specified by the removal command.  This will allow
tricky shorts (like ones with colour in) to be removed.

'approve auto item test <object>' checks the object to see if could
be sold and returns the limit that would be specified for it.
