This list can be seen using the 'approve list' command.The items in the approve list are all give ids and they must be used to reference these items.  Please note these ids are totaly seperate to the ids used in the shop itself.The items can be approved with the command 'approve item <id>' and rejected with the command 'approve reject <id>'.  When you approve an item the shop will try and take the money it will cost to approve it from your inventory.  If you do not have enough money to approve the item, the shop will refuse to put the item into the shops inventory.Before you let an item be approve you may wish to check to see if it is really what they say it is.  There a few commands that allow you to do this.  The first one is 'approve browse <id>' which allows you to look at the short and long descriptions and the read message of an item.You can change the category and name of the item before it is approved using 'approve change name <id> to <name>' and 'approve chane category <id> to <name>'.  You can still change the name and the category of an object after it has been sold using the 'change name of <object> to <string>', 'change category of <object> to <string>' and 'change price of <object> to <string>'.  You cannot change the price before the item is accepted since this is the price that the person that is selling it is willing to part with it for.The other method of checking items is using the 'approve checkout <id>' and 'approve checkin <object>' commands.  These allow an object to be taken out of the approval list and checked over without actually buying the object.  If you loose the object in some way after you have checked it out (burying it or whatever) then the person who sold the item will be credited with the money for actually selling it to the shop.  So be careful not to destroy the object.  Once you have finished examining it you can check it back in for approval/rejection.
