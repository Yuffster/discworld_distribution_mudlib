This allows the player to (for instance) setup larger margins for certain sorts of players.There are two ways to control items for sale, one is setting an expression instead of a value with the auto item control and the other is setting up a sequence of expressions to check when any item is sold.It is only in the case of these sorts of sales that the \"objectvalue\", \"objectcondition\" and other object related variables have any relevance.  The value will always be the lowest of the collection of items (if more than one thing is sold).  The expressions used in auto items must always return a money value.When setting up the free form expressions you setup two things, one is a boolean expression to check to see if the item should match the value expression and the other is the cost at which the item will be cut off.  This can be used to determine things like maximum cost of an object by the shop so that invalid results are not used in other parts of the shop.'approve auto expression accept add <condition> cost <cost>' is used to setup specific conditions for matching items.'approve auto expression deny add <condition>' is used to setup specific conditions under which items should be denied sale.
