Now you are dead, you want to come back to life?  If so, there
are several methods of doing so.  One method is to track down a
priest who has the right connections with the gods, they will
be able to raise you from the dead and give you a new body.
One of the other methods is to get to the Temple of Small Gods in
Ankh-Morpork and track down Harry.  Harry (out of the
goodness of his heart, assuming you have not killed him
recently) will bring you back to life.

There are a few other locations scattered around in the
surroundings of Ankh-Morpork and the Ramtops to get raised,
look and ye shall find.
