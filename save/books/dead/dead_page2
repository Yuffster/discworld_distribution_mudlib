.SP 5 5
You have died.  You are now in the afterlife.  What should you
do now?  Philosophers have been asking this question since the
dawn of time, the best answer they have come up with is:
Make it up as you go along.  Things you probably wish to
worry about once you have died are finding a way to come back
to life and making sure somebody does not run off with all your
ill begotten...  I mean hard earned equipment.  The following
chapter will go into this subject in more depth.  Finally; Do not panic!,
Death is not the end.  You have much life ahead of you.  Leap and
jump for joy in the knowledge you have now the experienced the final pain;
that pain which will only occur once in your
now very short life.  Be refreshed by
the last squirming hold on the land of living and let yourself
be free to truly appreciate the freshness of the air and the
tang of the afterlife.

To help you on your way, here are some quotes from famous
