If you are completely at a loss and you are dead.  Try the command
'godmother', they will take poor dead you back to Harry to be raised.
It will cost you quite a bit of life
energy to achieve this however.

If you do not wish to take this extreme option, buy some string.  Or
remember to leave crumbs behind you as you walk.
