.EP
.SI 5
%^CYAN%^whereis <player>%^RESET%^
will give you the location of the named player, and the command:
%^CYAN%^people%^RESET%^
on its own will list the names and locations of all players.

.SH How to go to a room
.SP 5 5
Going to a room is a bit more complex.  You need to first know the
path of the room.  This can be found by using:
.EP
.SP 5 5
%^CYAN%^cd%^RESET%^ (change directory) and %^CYAN%^ls%^RESET%^
(list directory) and moving through the directory structure until you find
the desired room.  You can also find the path you want by asking
another cre, by noting convenient spots as you walk around, and
writing them down, etc.  Once you know the path, the command is:
.EP
.SI 5
%^CYAN%^goto <path>%^RESET%^.

.SH How to bring a player to you
.SP 5 5
The best way to bring a player to you is with Ceres' Transporter,
since this keeps a portal open to the player's previous location.
Otherwise, you can use:
.EP
.SI 5 5
%^CYAN%^trans <player>%^RESET%^.
.EI
.SP 5 5
%^RED%^***%^RESET%^ Remember to note the player's original location so
you can go there, and trans her back. %^RED%^***%^RESET%^
.EP
