.SP 5 5
When a player dies through a bug, it is sometimes necessary to
resurrect her.  The simplest way to do this is with Oblilix's
Resurrector, found in your bookcase.  However, the actual call
can also be used:
.EP
.SI 5
%^CYAN%^call remove_ghost() <player>%^RESET%^.
For example:
%^CYAN%^call remove_ghost() ycore%^RESET%^.
In some cases, you may also want to replace, or adjust, the
maximum number of lives a player has.  The call for this is:
%^CYAN%^call adjust_max_deaths(number) <player>%^RESET%^.
For example:
%^CYAN%^call adjust_max_deaths(1) lagger%^RESET%^.
