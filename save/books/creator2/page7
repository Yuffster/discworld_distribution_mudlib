.SH To reset a room or item
.SP 5 5
Sometimes, all you need to do to solve a player's problem is to
reset the room or item that seems to have a problem.  Use great care
when updating rooms, because this will clear out any items in the room
that don't belong there.  Update syntax is:

%^CYAN%^update <path> %^RESET%^(if you know the path to the item
or room.)

%^CYAN%^update <item> in <player> %^RESET%^(to update something in
the player's inv.)

%^CYAN%^update here %^RESET%^(to update the room you are in.)
