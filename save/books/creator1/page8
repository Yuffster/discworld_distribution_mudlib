.SH Presto's Wand
.SP 5 5
Probably the single most useful item I've found, Presto's wand
is set up to allow a creator to replace a player's missing items
without having to hunt though the various directories to find
the correct file.  It also advises the user when the requested
replacement might not fit the normal guidelines, for example,
replacing items for a level 300+ character, or an amount of money
greater than the recommended A$30. A creator can also determine
which items are eligible for replacement simply by reading the
wand.

The command syntax is 'replace <item> for <player>'
