Once in your workroom, have a look at the bookcase.
On it you should find a couple of books and several other items.
These are Presto's Wand, a Green Jade Scarab, Obilix's Resurrector,
Ceres' Transporter, an Arcane Instrument, a Gagger and a
Typewriter. These are very useful
items, because they will allow you to start using some creator
abilities without having to hunt for the necessary calls.
Their uses are described on the next few pages.A
