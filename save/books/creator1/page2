Congratulations, you've been promoted to Creator status.

Now what?

At this point, the first thing you need to do, is get in
touch with your Domain Lord, and get set up with a project.
Note that Liaison Cre's should also mail the Lords of
the Domain and Guilds that they
are liaising for, and ask to be added to those Domains.
Also, remember that as a Cre, you can access mail from anywhere,
without having to find a Post Office.
