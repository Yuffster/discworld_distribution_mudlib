It also advises the user when the requested replacement might not fit the normal guidelines, for example, replacing items for a level 300+ character, or an amount of money greater than the recommended A$30. A creator can also determine which items are eligible for replacement simply by reading the wand.The command syntax is 'replace <item> for <player>' ","",})
