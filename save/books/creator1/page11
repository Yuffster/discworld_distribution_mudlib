.SH Jeremy's Arcane Instrument
.SP 5 5
This is a very useful device used to track and compare player's idle
and active times over a period of time.  This is mostly useful in
providing evidence of multi-playing, where one character will sit
idle until the player switches to that character.  With this tool
and a bit of on the scene observation one can investigate claims of
multiplaying.
