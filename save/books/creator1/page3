.SH Workroom
.SP 5 5
In your home directory you will find a default workroom,
which will contain a few useful items. You can get there with
'goto workroom' as long as you are logged in to your home directory.
I would suggest creating an 'alias home goto /w/yournamehere/workroom'
command to take you there from where ever you are.
