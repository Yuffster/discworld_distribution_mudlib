.SP 5 5
This device is to be used sparingly, if at all.  All uses of
the gagger are logged.  The purpose of the gagger is to remove
the ability to chat or shout from obnoxious or abusive players.
Please make sure that the player has been warned before resorting
to this measure.  If the warning is ignored, feel free. :-)
