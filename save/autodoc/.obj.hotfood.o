Thisstarts at a value of twenty times the original weight of the hot food and determines how long it takes to cool down.  Larger itemscool more slowly.<P>The level of cooling is shown in the long and short of the object.These are created using query_short_rotten_adjective and query_long_decay_level, and are based on the percentage by which it has cooled.<P>Differant messages can be displayed when the food is eaten hot or coldThese can be set using set_hot_eat_message() and set_cold_eat_message()Messages can also be set for eating bites of food where appropriateusing setup_cold_eat_piece_messages() and setup_hot_eat_piece_messages()",}),])
