This is default at water, and can be queried using query_melt_result().<P>It's melt level can be checked by query_melt_level().  Thisstarts at a value of ten times the original weight of the meltable food.<P>It's rate of melting adjusts itself regularly, based on thetemperature.  This can be checked with query_melt_rate(), andset temporarily with set_melt_rate.<P>The level of melting is shown in the long and short of the object.These are created using query_short_rotten_adjective and query_long_decay_level, and are based on the percentage of object left.",}),])
