* I (Hobbes) must be informed (tells or mud mail) about every 
change and addition to the souls, unless you have been
an 'approved soul adder' (takes years of blood, sweat and 
tears).

* Remember to keep the quality up. We want souls that the
players will use and appreciate.

* We're not aiming for quantity, coding every possible soul
command there is.

* Many of the souls that players suggest are much better off
as remotes, for example very "personal" souls, that only
1 player or creator think is cool (and needless to say, that
goes for 2 players or 2 creators as well).

* That's why you have to tread very varily when it comes
to 'narrow' souls, opposed to 'broad' ones.

Examples of suggestions where the soul is 'narrow'

"lakitu yarrg players yarrgs!" or "cuchulainn meep Its a
disgrace seeing  People "beep like roadrunner" i suggest
that the soul meep lik roadrunner is coded"

"Soul: np Output: Kiaril says "No Problem!" to you, in a 
confident tone that sets you quaking in your boots.

Examples of suggestions where the soul is of a'broad' kind:
"You should be able to 'relax'" or "you should be able
to look 'shocked'".

Notice the difference? This is hard to explain, but I think
you know what I'm trying to say. There is a very vague red
thread in the souls that are added.
Basically, it all comes down to common sense!!!

If you feel unsure about this, suggest the changes to me
before actually implementing any.

* Keep internal player or creator jokes out of the standard,
also player/creator names in the souls, out.

* Be very careful with souls out of DW theme. Some work, like
'spock', or 'fonz'. An 'arnold' soul, for example (I'll be bak),
does not, neither does: "You go "duuuh" like the girl in the
Pepsi commercial"

Why? Perhaps because Spock and the Fonz are timeless nerdy 
classics, and the others not.

* Also be careful with outputs such as "You go "whee!!!"
running around the room". They look awful: "You go", "You 
say", etc
